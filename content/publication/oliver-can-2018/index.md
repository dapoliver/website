abstract: Reduction of duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) is the key strategy of
  early interventions for improving the outcomes of first-episode psychosis. Although  several
  controlled interventional studies have been conducted with the aim of  reducing
  DUP, the results are highly inconsistent and conflicting. The current study  systematically
  searches Web of Science and Ovid for English original articles  investigating interventions
  adopted to reduce DUP, compared to a control  intervention, up to April 6, 2017.
  Sixteen controlled interventional studies were  retrieved, including 1964 patients
  in the intervention arm and 1358 in the control  arm. The controlled intervention
  studies were characterized by standalone first  episode psychosis services, standalone
  clinical high risk services, community  interventions, healthcare professional training,
  and multifocus interventions.  Random effects meta-analyses were conducted. There
  was no summary evidence that  available interventions are successful in reducing
  DUP during the first episode of  psychosis (Hedges' g = -0.12, 95% CI = -0.25 to
  0.01). Subgroup analyses showed no  differences within each subgroup, with the exception
  of clinical high risk services  (Hedges' g = -0.386, 95% CI = -0.726 to -0.045).
  These negative findings may reflect  a parceled research base in the area, lack
  of prospective randomized controlled  trials (only 2 randomized cluster designed
  studies were present) and small sample  sizes. There was substantial heterogeneity
  (I2 = 66.4%), most of which was accounted  by different definitions of DUP onset
  (R2 = .88). Psychometric standardization of  DUP definition, improvement of study
  design, and implementation of preventative  strategies seem the most promising avenues
  for reducing DUP and improving outcomes  of first-episode psychosis.
