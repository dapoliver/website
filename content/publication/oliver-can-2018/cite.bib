 abstract = {Reduction of duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) is the key strategy of early interventions for improving the outcomes of first-episode psychosis. Although  several controlled interventional studies have been conducted with the aim of  reducing DUP, the results are highly inconsistent and conflicting. The current study  systematically searches Web of Science and Ovid for English original articles  investigating interventions adopted to reduce DUP, compared to a control  intervention, up to April 6, 2017. Sixteen controlled interventional studies were  retrieved, including 1964 patients in the intervention arm and 1358 in the control  arm. The controlled intervention studies were characterized by standalone first  episode psychosis services, standalone clinical high risk services, community  interventions, healthcare professional training, and multifocus interventions.  Random effects meta-analyses were conducted. There was no summary evidence that  available interventions are successful in reducing DUP during the first episode of  psychosis (Hedges' g = -0.12, 95% CI = -0.25 to 0.01). Subgroup analyses showed no  differences within each subgroup, with the exception of clinical high risk services  (Hedges' g = -0.386, 95% CI = -0.726 to -0.045). These negative findings may reflect  a parceled research base in the area, lack of prospective randomized controlled  trials (only 2 randomized cluster designed studies were present) and small sample  sizes. There was substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 66.4%), most of which was accounted  by different definitions of DUP onset (R2 = .88). Psychometric standardization of  DUP definition, improvement of study design, and implementation of preventative  strategies seem the most promising avenues for reducing DUP and improving outcomes  of first-episode psychosis.},
