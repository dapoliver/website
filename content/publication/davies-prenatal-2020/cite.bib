 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prenatal and perinatal insults are implicated in the aetiopathogenesis of psychotic disorders but the consistency and magnitude of their associations with  psychosis have not been updated for nearly two decades. The aim of this systematic  review and meta-analysis was to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of  the evidence on the association between prenatal or perinatal risk and protective  factors and psychotic disorders. METHODS: In this systematic review and  meta-analysis, we searched the Web of Science database for articles published up to  July 20, 2019. We identified cohort and case-control studies examining the  association (odds ratio [OR]) between prenatal and perinatal factors and any  International Classification of Diseases (ICD) or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual  of Mental Disorders (DSM) non-organic psychotic disorder with a healthy comparison  group. Other inclusion criteria were enough data available to do the analyses, and  non-overlapping datasets. We excluded reviews, meta-analyses, abstracts or  conference proceedings, and articles with overlapping datasets. Data were extracted  according to EQUATOR and PRISMA guidelines. Extracted variables included first  author, publication year, study type, sample size, type of psychotic diagnosis  (non-affective psychoses or schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, affective psychoses)  and diagnostic instrument (DSM or ICD and version), the risk or protective factor,  and measure of association (primary outcome). We did random-effects pairwise  meta-analyses, Q statistics, I(2) index, sensitivity analyses, meta-regressions, and  assessed study quality and publication bias. The study protocol was registered at  PROSPERO, CRD42017079261. FINDINGS: 152 studies relating to 98 risk or protective  factors were eligible for analysis. Significant risk factors were: maternal age  younger than 20 years (OR 1·17) and 30-34 years (OR 1·05); paternal age younger than  20 years (OR 1·31) and older than 35 years (OR 1·28); any maternal (OR 4·60) or  paternal (OR 2·73) psychopathology; maternal psychosis (OR 7·61) and affective  disorder (OR 2·26); three or more pregnancies (OR 1·30); herpes simplex 2 (OR 1·35);  maternal infections not otherwise specified (NOS; OR 1·27); suboptimal number of  antenatal visits (OR 1·83); winter (OR 1·05) and winter to spring (OR 1·05) season  of birth in the northern hemisphere; maternal stress NOS (OR 2·40); famine (OR  1·61); any famine or nutritional deficits in pregnancy (OR 1·40); maternal  hypertension (OR 1·40); hypoxia (OR 1·63); ruptured (OR 1·86) and premature rupture  (OR 2·29) of membranes; polyhydramnios (OR 3·05); definite obstetric complications  NOS (OR 1·83); birthweights of less than 2000 g (OR 1·84), less than 2500 g (OR  1·53), or 2500-2999 g (OR 1·23); birth length less than 49 cm (OR 1·17); small for  gestational age (OR 1·40); premature birth (OR 1·35), and congenital malformations  (OR 2·35). Significant protective factors were maternal ages 20-24 years (OR 0·93)  and 25-29 years (OR 0·92), nulliparity (OR 0·91), and birthweights 3500-3999 g (OR  0·90) or more than 4000 g (OR 0·86). The results were corrected for publication  biases; sensitivity and meta-regression analyses confirmed the robustness of these  findings for most factors. INTERPRETATION: Several prenatal and perinatal factors  are associated with the later onset of psychosis. The updated knowledge emerging  from this study could refine understanding of psychosis pathogenesis, enhance  multivariable risk prediction, and inform preventive strategies. FUNDING: None.},
