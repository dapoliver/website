 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Using novel data mining methods such as natural language processing (NLP) on electronic health records (EHRs) for screening and detecting individuals at  risk for psychosis. METHOD: The study included all patients receiving a first index  diagnosis of nonorganic and nonpsychotic mental disorder within the South London and  Maudsley (SLaM) NHS Foundation Trust between January 1, 2008, and July 28, 2018.  Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)-regularized Cox regression  was used to refine and externally validate a refined version of a five-item  individualized, transdiagnostic, clinically based risk calculator previously  developed (Harrell's C = 0.79) and piloted for implementation. The refined version  included 14 additional NLP-predictors: tearfulness, poor appetite, weight loss,  insomnia, cannabis, cocaine, guilt, irritability, delusions, hopelessness, disturbed  sleep, poor insight, agitation, and paranoia. RESULTS: A total of 92 151 patients  with a first index diagnosis of nonorganic and nonpsychotic mental disorder within  the SLaM Trust were included in the derivation (n = 28 297) or external validation  (n = 63 854) data sets. Mean age was 33.6 years, 50.7% were women, and 67.0% were of  white race/ethnicity. Mean follow-up was 1590 days. The overall 6-year risk of  psychosis in secondary mental health care was 3.4 (95% CI, 3.3-3.6). External  validation indicated strong performance on unseen data (Harrell's C 0.85, 95% CI  0.84-0.86), an increase of 0.06 from the original model. CONCLUSIONS: Using NLP on  EHRs can considerably enhance the prognostic accuracy of psychosis risk calculators.  This can help identify patients at risk of psychosis who require assessment and  specialized care, facilitating earlier detection and potentially improving patient  outcomes.},
