abstract: "BACKGROUND: Using novel data mining methods such as natural language processing\
  \ (NLP) on electronic health records (EHRs) for screening and detecting individuals\
  \ at  risk for psychosis. METHOD: The study included all patients receiving a first\
  \ index  diagnosis of nonorganic and nonpsychotic mental disorder within the South\
  \ London and  Maudsley (SLaM) NHS Foundation Trust between January 1, 2008, and\
  \ July 28, 2018.  Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)-regularized\
  \ Cox regression  was used to refine and externally validate a refined version of\
  \ a five-item  individualized, transdiagnostic, clinically based risk calculator\
  \ previously  developed (Harrell's C = 0.79) and piloted for implementation. The\
  \ refined version  included 14 additional NLP-predictors: tearfulness, poor appetite,\
  \ weight loss,  insomnia, cannabis, cocaine, guilt, irritability, delusions, hopelessness,\
  \ disturbed  sleep, poor insight, agitation, and paranoia. RESULTS: A total of 92\
  \ 151 patients  with a first index diagnosis of nonorganic and nonpsychotic mental\
  \ disorder within  the SLaM Trust were included in the derivation (n = 28 297) or\
  \ external validation  (n = 63 854) data sets. Mean age was 33.6 years, 50.7% were\
  \ women, and 67.0% were of  white race/ethnicity. Mean follow-up was 1590 days.\
  \ The overall 6-year risk of  psychosis in secondary mental health care was 3.4\
  \ (95% CI, 3.3-3.6). External  validation indicated strong performance on unseen\
  \ data (Harrell's C 0.85, 95% CI  0.84-0.86), an increase of 0.06 from the original\
  \ model. CONCLUSIONS: Using NLP on  EHRs can considerably enhance the prognostic\
  \ accuracy of psychosis risk calculators.  This can help identify patients at risk\
  \ of psychosis who require assessment and  specialized care, facilitating earlier\
  \ detection and potentially improving patient  outcomes."
