 abstract = {Primary prevention in individuals at Clinical High Risk for psychosis (CHR-P) can ameliorate the course of psychotic disorders. Further advancements of knowledge have  been slowed by the standstill of the field, which is mostly attributed to its  epidemiological weakness. The latter, in turn, underlies the limited identification  power of at-risk individuals and the relatively modest ability of CHR-P interviews  to rule-in a state of risk for psychosis. In the first part, this perspective review  discusses these limitations and traces a new approach to overcome them. Theoretical  concepts to support a Psychosis Polyrisk Score (PPS) integrating genetic and  non-genetic risk and protective factors for psychosis are presented. The PPS hinges  on recent findings indicating that risk enrichment in CHR-P samples is accounted for  by the accumulation of non-genetic factors such as: parental and sociodemographic  risk factors, perinatal risk factors, later risk factors, and antecedents. In the  second part of this perspective review we present a prototype of a PPS encompassing  core predictors beyond genetics. The PPS prototype may be piloted in the next  generation of CHR-P research and combined with genetic information to refine the  detection of individuals at-risk of psychosis and the prediction of their outcomes,  and ultimately advance clinical research in this field.},
