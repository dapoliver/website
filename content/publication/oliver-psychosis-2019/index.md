abstract: 'Primary prevention in individuals at Clinical High Risk for psychosis (CHR-P)
  can ameliorate the course of psychotic disorders. Further advancements of knowledge
  have  been slowed by the standstill of the field, which is mostly attributed to
  its  epidemiological weakness. The latter, in turn, underlies the limited identification  power
  of at-risk individuals and the relatively modest ability of CHR-P interviews  to
  rule-in a state of risk for psychosis. In the first part, this perspective review  discusses
  these limitations and traces a new approach to overcome them. Theoretical  concepts
  to support a Psychosis Polyrisk Score (PPS) integrating genetic and  non-genetic
  risk and protective factors for psychosis are presented. The PPS hinges  on recent
  findings indicating that risk enrichment in CHR-P samples is accounted for  by the
  accumulation of non-genetic factors such as: parental and sociodemographic  risk
  factors, perinatal risk factors, later risk factors, and antecedents. In the  second
  part of this perspective review we present a prototype of a PPS encompassing  core
  predictors beyond genetics. The PPS prototype may be piloted in the next  generation
  of CHR-P research and combined with genetic information to refine the  detection
  of individuals at-risk of psychosis and the prediction of their outcomes,  and ultimately
  advance clinical research in this field.'
