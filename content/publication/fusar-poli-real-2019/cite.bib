 abstract = {Background: Primary indicated prevention in individuals at-risk for psychosis has the potential to improve the outcomes of this disorder. The ability to detect the  majority of at-risk individuals is the main barrier toward extending benefits for  the lives of many adolescents and young adults. Current detection strategies are  highly inefficient. Only 5% (standalone specialized early detection services) to 12%  (youth mental health services) of individuals who will develop a first psychotic  disorder can be detected at the time of their at-risk stage. To overcome these  challenges a pragmatic, clinically-based, individualized, transdiagnostic risk  calculator has been developed to detect individuals at-risk of psychosis in  secondary mental health care at scale. This calculator has been externally validated  and has demonstrated good prognostic performance. However, it is not known whether  it can be used in the real world clinical routine. For example, clinicians may not  be willing to adhere to the recommendations made by the transdiagnostic risk  calculator. Implementation studies are needed to address pragmatic challenges  relating to the real world use of the transdiagnostic risk calculator. The aim of  the current study is to provide in-vitro and in-vivo feasibility data to support the  implementation of the transdiagnostic risk calculator in clinical routine. Method:  This is a study which comprises of two subsequent phases: an in-vitro phase of 1  month and an in-vivo phase of 11 months. The in-vitro phase aims at developing and  integrating the transdiagnostic risk calculator in the local electronic health  register (primary outcome). The in-vivo phase aims at addressing the clinicians'  adherence to the recommendations made by the transdiagnostic risk calculator  (primary outcome) and other secondary feasibility parameters that are necessary to  estimate the resources needed for its implementation. Discussion: This is the first  implementation study for risk prediction models in individuals at-risk for  psychosis. Ultimately, successful implementation is the true measure of a prediction  model's utility. Therefore, the overall translational deliverable of the current  study would be to extend the benefits of primary indicated prevention and improve  outcomes of first episode psychosis. This may produce significant social benefits  for many adolescents and young adults and their families.},
