abstract: "Background: Primary indicated prevention in individuals at-risk for psychosis\
  \ has the potential to improve the outcomes of this disorder. The ability to detect\
  \ the  majority of at-risk individuals is the main barrier toward extending benefits\
  \ for  the lives of many adolescents and young adults. Current detection strategies\
  \ are  highly inefficient. Only 5% (standalone specialized early detection services)\
  \ to 12%  (youth mental health services) of individuals who will develop a first\
  \ psychotic  disorder can be detected at the time of their at-risk stage. To overcome\
  \ these  challenges a pragmatic, clinically-based, individualized, transdiagnostic\
  \ risk  calculator has been developed to detect individuals at-risk of psychosis\
  \ in  secondary mental health care at scale. This calculator has been externally\
  \ validated  and has demonstrated good prognostic performance. However, it is not\
  \ known whether  it can be used in the real world clinical routine. For example,\
  \ clinicians may not  be willing to adhere to the recommendations made by the transdiagnostic\
  \ risk  calculator. Implementation studies are needed to address pragmatic challenges\
  \  relating to the real world use of the transdiagnostic risk calculator. The aim\
  \ of  the current study is to provide in-vitro and in-vivo feasibility data to support\
  \ the  implementation of the transdiagnostic risk calculator in clinical routine.\
  \ Method:  This is a study which comprises of two subsequent phases: an in-vitro\
  \ phase of 1  month and an in-vivo phase of 11 months. The in-vitro phase aims at\
  \ developing and  integrating the transdiagnostic risk calculator in the local electronic\
  \ health  register (primary outcome). The in-vivo phase aims at addressing the clinicians'\
  \  adherence to the recommendations made by the transdiagnostic risk calculator\
  \  (primary outcome) and other secondary feasibility parameters that are necessary\
  \ to  estimate the resources needed for its implementation. Discussion: This is\
  \ the first  implementation study for risk prediction models in individuals at-risk\
  \ for  psychosis. Ultimately, successful implementation is the true measure of a\
  \ prediction  model's utility. Therefore, the overall translational deliverable\
  \ of the current  study would be to extend the benefits of primary indicated prevention\
  \ and improve  outcomes of first episode psychosis. This may produce significant\
  \ social benefits  for many adolescents and young adults and their families."
