abstract: Conversation between two people involves subtle nonverbal coordination in
  addition to speech. However, the precise parameters and timing of this coordination
  remain  unclear, which limits our ability to theorize about the neural and cognitive  mechanisms
  of social coordination. In particular, it is unclear if conversation is  dominated
  by synchronization (with no time lag), rapid and reactive mimicry (with  lags under
  1 s) or traditionally observed mimicry (with several seconds lag), each  of which
  demands a different neural mechanism. Here we describe data from  high-resolution
  motion capture of the head movements of pairs of participants  (n = 31 dyads) engaged
  in structured conversations. In a pre-registered analysis  pathway, we calculated
  the wavelet coherence of head motion within dyads as a  measure of their nonverbal
  coordination and report two novel results. First,  low-frequency coherence (0.2-1.1 Hz)
  is consistent with traditional observations of  mimicry, and modeling shows this
  behavior is generated by a mechanism with a  constant 600 ms lag between leader
  and follower. This is in line with rapid reactive  (rather than predictive or memory-driven)
  models of mimicry behavior, and could be  implemented in mirror neuron systems.
  Second, we find an unexpected pattern of  lower-than-chance coherence between participants,
  or hypo-coherence, at high  frequencies (2.6-6.5 Hz). Exploratory analyses show
  that this systematic decoupling  is driven by fast nodding from the listening member
  of the dyad, and may be a newly  identified social signal. These results provide
  a step towards the quantification of  real-world human behavior in high resolution
  and provide new insights into the  mechanisms of social coordination.
