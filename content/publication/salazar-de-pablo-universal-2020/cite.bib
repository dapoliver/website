 abstract = {Promotion of good mental health in young people is important. Our aim was to evaluate the consistency and magnitude of the efficacy of universal/selective  interventions to promote good mental health. A systematic PRISMA/RIGHT-compliant  meta-analysis (PROSPERO: CRD42018088708) search of Web of Science until 04/31/2019  identified original studies comparing the efficacy of universal/selective  interventions for good mental health vs a control group, in samples with a mean age  \textless35 years. Meta-analytical random-effects model, heterogeneity statistics,  assessment of publication bias, study quality and sensitivity analyses investigated  the efficacy (Hedges' g=effect size, ES) of universal/selective interventions to  promote 14 good mental health outcomes defined a-priori. 276 studies were included  (total participants: 159,508, 79,142 interventions and 80,366 controls), mean  age=15.0 (SD=7.4); female=56.0%. There was a significant overall improvement in  10/13 good mental health outcome categories that could be meta-analysed: compared to  controls, interventions significantly improved (in descending order of magnitude)  mental health literacy (ES=0.685, p\textless0.001), emotions (ES=0.541, p\textless0.001),  self-perceptions and values (ES=0.49, p\textless0.001), quality of life (ES=0.457, p=0.001),  cognitive skills (ES=0.428, p\textless0.001), social skills (ES=0.371, p\textless0.001), physical  health (ES=0.285, p\textless0.001), sexual health (ES=0.257, p=0.017), academic/occupational  performance (ES=0.211, p\textless0.001) and attitude towards mental disorders (ES=0.177,  p=0.006). Psychoeducation was the most effective intervention for promoting mental  health literacy (ES=0.774, p\textless0.001) and cognitive skills (ES=1.153, p=0.03).  Physical therapy, exercise and relaxation were more effective than psychoeducation  and psychotherapy for promoting physical health (ES=0.498, p\textless0.001). In conclusion,  several universal/selective interventions can be effective to promote good mental  health in young people. Future research should consolidate and extend these  findings.},
