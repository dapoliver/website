abstract: "Promotion of good mental health in young people is important. Our aim was\
  \ to evaluate the consistency and magnitude of the efficacy of universal/selective\
  \  interventions to promote good mental health. A systematic PRISMA/RIGHT-compliant\
  \  meta-analysis (PROSPERO: CRD42018088708) search of Web of Science until 04/31/2019\
  \  identified original studies comparing the efficacy of universal/selective  interventions\
  \ for good mental health vs a control group, in samples with a mean age  textless35\
  \ years. Meta-analytical random-effects model, heterogeneity statistics,  assessment\
  \ of publication bias, study quality and sensitivity analyses investigated  the\
  \ efficacy (Hedges' g=effect size, ES) of universal/selective interventions to \
  \ promote 14 good mental health outcomes defined a-priori. 276 studies were included\
  \  (total participants: 159,508, 79,142 interventions and 80,366 controls), mean\
  \  age=15.0 (SD=7.4); female=56.0%. There was a significant overall improvement\
  \ in  10/13 good mental health outcome categories that could be meta-analysed: compared\
  \ to  controls, interventions significantly improved (in descending order of magnitude)\
  \  mental health literacy (ES=0.685, ptextless0.001), emotions (ES=0.541, ptextless0.001),\
  \  self-perceptions and values (ES=0.49, ptextless0.001), quality of life (ES=0.457,\
  \ p=0.001),  cognitive skills (ES=0.428, ptextless0.001), social skills (ES=0.371,\
  \ ptextless0.001), physical  health (ES=0.285, ptextless0.001), sexual health (ES=0.257,\
  \ p=0.017), academic/occupational  performance (ES=0.211, ptextless0.001) and attitude\
  \ towards mental disorders (ES=0.177,  p=0.006). Psychoeducation was the most effective\
  \ intervention for promoting mental  health literacy (ES=0.774, ptextless0.001)\
  \ and cognitive skills (ES=1.153, p=0.03).  Physical therapy, exercise and relaxation\
  \ were more effective than psychoeducation  and psychotherapy for promoting physical\
  \ health (ES=0.498, ptextless0.001). In conclusion,  several universal/selective\
  \ interventions can be effective to promote good mental  health in young people.\
  \ Future research should consolidate and extend these  findings."
