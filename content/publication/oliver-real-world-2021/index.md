abstract: "BACKGROUND: Risk estimation models integrated into Electronic Health Records\
  \ (EHRs) can deliver innovative approaches in psychiatry, but clinicians' endorsement\
  \ and  their real-world usability are unknown. This study aimed to investigate the\
  \  real-world feasibility of implementing an individualised, transdiagnostic risk\
  \  calculator to automatically screen EHRs and detect individuals at-risk for  psychosis.\
  \ METHODS: Feasibility implementation study encompassing an in-vitro phase  (March\
  \ 2018 to May 2018) and in-vivo phase (May 2018 to April 2019). The in-vitro  phase\
  \ addressed implementation barriers and embedded the risk calculator  (predictors:\
  \ age, gender, ethnicity, index cluster diagnosis, age*gender) into the  local EHR.\
  \ The in-vivo phase investigated the real-world feasibility of screening  individuals\
  \ accessing secondary mental healthcare at the South London and Maudsley  NHS Trust.\
  \ The primary outcome was adherence of clinicians to automatic EHR  screening, defined\
  \ by the proportion of clinicians who responded to alerts from the  risk calculator,\
  \ over those contacted. RESULTS: In-vitro phase: implementation  barriers were identified/overcome\
  \ with clinician and service user engagement, and  the calculator was successfully\
  \ integrated into the local EHR through the CogStack  platform. In-vivo phase: 3722\
  \ individuals were automatically screened and 115 were  detected. Clinician adherence\
  \ was 74% without outreach and 85% with outreach.  One-third of clinicians responded\
  \ to the first email (37.1%) or phone calls (33.7%).  Among those detected, cumulative\
  \ risk of developing psychosis was 12% at six-month  follow-up. CONCLUSION: This\
  \ is the first implementation study suggesting that  combining precision psychiatry\
  \ and EHR methods to improve detection of individuals  with emerging psychosis is\
  \ feasible. Future psychiatric implementation research is  urgently needed."
