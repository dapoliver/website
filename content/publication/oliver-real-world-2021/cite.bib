 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Risk estimation models integrated into Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can deliver innovative approaches in psychiatry, but clinicians' endorsement and  their real-world usability are unknown. This study aimed to investigate the  real-world feasibility of implementing an individualised, transdiagnostic risk  calculator to automatically screen EHRs and detect individuals at-risk for  psychosis. METHODS: Feasibility implementation study encompassing an in-vitro phase  (March 2018 to May 2018) and in-vivo phase (May 2018 to April 2019). The in-vitro  phase addressed implementation barriers and embedded the risk calculator  (predictors: age, gender, ethnicity, index cluster diagnosis, age*gender) into the  local EHR. The in-vivo phase investigated the real-world feasibility of screening  individuals accessing secondary mental healthcare at the South London and Maudsley  NHS Trust. The primary outcome was adherence of clinicians to automatic EHR  screening, defined by the proportion of clinicians who responded to alerts from the  risk calculator, over those contacted. RESULTS: In-vitro phase: implementation  barriers were identified/overcome with clinician and service user engagement, and  the calculator was successfully integrated into the local EHR through the CogStack  platform. In-vivo phase: 3722 individuals were automatically screened and 115 were  detected. Clinician adherence was 74% without outreach and 85% with outreach.  One-third of clinicians responded to the first email (37.1%) or phone calls (33.7%).  Among those detected, cumulative risk of developing psychosis was 12% at six-month  follow-up. CONCLUSION: This is the first implementation study suggesting that  combining precision psychiatry and EHR methods to improve detection of individuals  with emerging psychosis is feasible. Future psychiatric implementation research is  urgently needed.},
