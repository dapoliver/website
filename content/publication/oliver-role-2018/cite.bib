 abstract = {Previous studies have shown right parietal activation in response to observing irrational actions. Behavioral studies show that people sometimes imitate irrational  actions, a phenomenon called overimitation. However, limitations on movement in  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) mean that the neural basis of  overimitation has not been studied. To address this, our study employed a less  restrictive neuroimaging technique, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).  Measurements were taken while participants observed either rational or irrational  movements before performing movements on a computerized puzzle task. Observing  irrational actions produced greater activation in right anterior inferior parietal  lobule (aIPL), replicating results from the fMRI literature. This is a proof of  principle that fNIRS can be used as an alternative to fMRI in social cognition  experiments, and that parietal cortex has a core role in responding to irrational  actions.},
