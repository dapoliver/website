abstract: Previous studies have shown right parietal activation in response to observing
  irrational actions. Behavioral studies show that people sometimes imitate irrational  actions,
  a phenomenon called overimitation. However, limitations on movement in  functional
  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) mean that the neural basis of  overimitation has
  not been studied. To address this, our study employed a less  restrictive neuroimaging
  technique, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).  Measurements were taken
  while participants observed either rational or irrational  movements before performing
  movements on a computerized puzzle task. Observing  irrational actions produced
  greater activation in right anterior inferior parietal  lobule (aIPL), replicating
  results from the fMRI literature. This is a proof of  principle that fNIRS can be
  used as an alternative to fMRI in social cognition  experiments, and that parietal
  cortex has a core role in responding to irrational  actions.
