abstract: "BACKGROUND: Primary indicated prevention is a key target for reducing the\
  \ incidence and burden of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. An individualised,\
  \  clinically-based transdiagnostic model for the detection of individuals at risk\
  \ of  psychosis has been developed and validated in two large, urban healthcare\
  \ providers.  We tested its external validity in a geographically and demographically\
  \ different  non-urban population. METHOD: Retrospective EHR cohort study. All individuals\
  \  accessing secondary healthcare provided by Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust\
  \  between 1st January 2011 and 30th November 2019 and receiving a primary index\
  \  diagnosis of a non-psychotic or non-organic mental disorder were considered \
  \ eligible. The previously developed model was applied to this database and its\
  \  external prognostic accuracy was measured with Harrell's C. FINDINGS: The study\
  \  included n = 33,710 eligible individuals, with an average age of 27.7 years \
  \ (SD = 19.8), mostly white (92.0%) and female (57.3%). The mean follow-up was \
  \ 1863.9 days (SD = 948.9), with 868 transitions to psychosis and a cumulative \
  \ incidence of psychosis at 6 years of 2.9% (95%CI: 2.7-3.1). Compared to the urban\
  \  development database, Oxford Health was characterised by a relevant case mix,\
  \ lower  incidence of psychosis, different distribution of baseline predictors,\
  \ higher  proportion of white females, and a lack of specialised clinical services\
  \ for at risk  individuals. Despite these differences the model retained an adequate\
  \ prognostic  performance (Harrell's C = 0.79, 95%CI: 0.78-0.81), with no major\
  \ miscalibration.  INTERPRETATION: The transdiagnostic, individualised, clinically-based\
  \ risk  calculator is transportable outside urban healthcare providers. Further\
  \ research  should test transportability of this risk prediction model in an international\
  \  setting."
