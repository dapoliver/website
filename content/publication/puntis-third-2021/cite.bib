 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Primary indicated prevention is a key target for reducing the incidence and burden of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. An individualised,  clinically-based transdiagnostic model for the detection of individuals at risk of  psychosis has been developed and validated in two large, urban healthcare providers.  We tested its external validity in a geographically and demographically different  non-urban population. METHOD: Retrospective EHR cohort study. All individuals  accessing secondary healthcare provided by Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust  between 1st January 2011 and 30th November 2019 and receiving a primary index  diagnosis of a non-psychotic or non-organic mental disorder were considered  eligible. The previously developed model was applied to this database and its  external prognostic accuracy was measured with Harrell's C. FINDINGS: The study  included n = 33,710 eligible individuals, with an average age of 27.7 years  (SD = 19.8), mostly white (92.0%) and female (57.3%). The mean follow-up was  1863.9 days (SD = 948.9), with 868 transitions to psychosis and a cumulative  incidence of psychosis at 6 years of 2.9% (95%CI: 2.7-3.1). Compared to the urban  development database, Oxford Health was characterised by a relevant case mix, lower  incidence of psychosis, different distribution of baseline predictors, higher  proportion of white females, and a lack of specialised clinical services for at risk  individuals. Despite these differences the model retained an adequate prognostic  performance (Harrell's C = 0.79, 95%CI: 0.78-0.81), with no major miscalibration.  INTERPRETATION: The transdiagnostic, individualised, clinically-based risk  calculator is transportable outside urban healthcare providers. Further research  should test transportability of this risk prediction model in an international  setting.},
