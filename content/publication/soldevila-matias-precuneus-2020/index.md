abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: The neural correlates of the cognitive dysfunction in first-episode
  psychosis (FEP) are still unclear. The present review and meta-analysis provide
  an  update of the location of the abnormalities in the fMRI-measured brain response
  to  cognitive processes in individuals with FEP. METHODS: Systematic review and  voxel-based
  meta-analysis of cross-sectional fMRI studies comparing neural responses  to cognitive
  tasks between individuals with FEP and healthy controls (HC) according  to PRISMA
  guidelines. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies were included, comprising 598  individuals
  with FEP and 567 HC. Individual studies reported statistically  significant hypoactivation
  in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (6 studies),  frontal lobe (8 studies), cingulate
  (6 studies) and insula (5 studies). The  meta-analysis showed statistically significant
  hypoactivation in the left anterior  insula, precuneus and bilateral striatum. CONCLUSIONS:
  While the studies tend to  highlight frontal hypoactivation during cognitive tasks
  in FEP, our meta-analytic  results show that the left precuneus and insula primarily
  display aberrant  activation in FEP that may be associated with salience attribution
  to external  stimuli and related to deficits in perception and regulation.'
