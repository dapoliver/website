 abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The neural correlates of the cognitive dysfunction in first-episode psychosis (FEP) are still unclear. The present review and meta-analysis provide an  update of the location of the abnormalities in the fMRI-measured brain response to  cognitive processes in individuals with FEP. METHODS: Systematic review and  voxel-based meta-analysis of cross-sectional fMRI studies comparing neural responses  to cognitive tasks between individuals with FEP and healthy controls (HC) according  to PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies were included, comprising 598  individuals with FEP and 567 HC. Individual studies reported statistically  significant hypoactivation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (6 studies),  frontal lobe (8 studies), cingulate (6 studies) and insula (5 studies). The  meta-analysis showed statistically significant hypoactivation in the left anterior  insula, precuneus and bilateral striatum. CONCLUSIONS: While the studies tend to  highlight frontal hypoactivation during cognitive tasks in FEP, our meta-analytic  results show that the left precuneus and insula primarily display aberrant  activation in FEP that may be associated with salience attribution to external  stimuli and related to deficits in perception and regulation.},
