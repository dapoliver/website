abstract: Social deficits are key hallmarks of the Clinical High Risk for Psychosis
  (CHR-P) state and of established psychotic disorders, and contribute to impaired
  social  functioning, indicating a potential target for interventions. However, current  treatments
  do not significantly ameliorate social impairments in CHR-P individuals.  Given
  its critical role in social behaviour and cognition, the oxytocinergic (OT)  system
  is a promising target for novel interventions in CHR-P subjects. In a  double-blind,
  placebo-controlled, crossover design, 30 CHR-P males were studied  using functional
  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on two occasions, once after 40IU  self-administered
  intranasal OT and once after placebo. A modified version of the  Sally-Anne task
  was used to assess brain activation during inferring others' beliefs  and social
  emotions. The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test was acquired prior to the  first
  scan to test whether OT effects were moderated by baseline social-emotional  abilities.
  OT did not modulate behavioural performances but reduced activation in  the bilateral
  inferior frontal gyrus compared with placebo while inferring others'  social emotions.
  Furthermore, the relationship between brain activation and task  performance after
  OT administration was moderated by baseline social-emotional  abilities. While task
  accuracy during inferring others' social emotion increased  with decreasing activation
  in the left inferior frontal gyrus in CHR-P individuals  with low social-emotional
  abilities, there was no such relationship in CHR-P  individuals with high social-emotional
  abilities. Our findings may suggest that  acute OT administration enhances neural
  efficiency in the inferior frontal gyrus  during inferring others' social emotions
  in those CHR-P subjects with low baseline  social-emotional abilities.
