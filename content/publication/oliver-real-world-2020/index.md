abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The Psychosis Polyrisk Score (PPS) is a potential biomarker
  integrating non-purely genetic risk/protective factors for psychosis that may improve  identification
  of individuals at risk and prediction of their outcomes at the  individual subject
  level. Biomarkers that are easy to administer are direly needed  in early psychosis
  to facilitate clinical implementation. This study digitally  implements the PPS
  and pilots its feasibility of use in the real world. METHODS: The  PPS was implemented
  digitally and prospectively piloted across individuals referred  for a CHR-P assessment
  (n = 16) and healthy controls (n = 66). Distribution of PPS  scores was further
  simulated in the general population. RESULTS: 98.8% of  individuals referred for
  a CHR-P assessment and healthy controls completed the PPS  assessment with only
  one drop-out. 96.3% of participants completed the assessment in  under 15 min. Individuals
  referred for a CHR-P assessment had high PPS scores  (mean = 6.2, SD = 7.23) than
  healthy controls (mean = -1.79, SD = 6.78, p textless 0.001).  In simulated general
  population data, scores were normally distributed ranging from  -15 (lowest risk,
  RR = 0.03) to 39.5 (highest risk, RR = 8912.51). DISCUSSION: The  PPS is a promising
  biomarker which has been implemented digitally. The PPS can be  easily administered
  to both healthy controls and individuals at potential risk for  psychosis on a range
  of devices. It is feasible to use the PPS in real world  settings to assess individuals
  with emerging mental disorders. The next phase of  research should be to include
  the PPS in large-scale international cohort studies to  evaluate its ability to
  refine the prognostication of outcomes.'
