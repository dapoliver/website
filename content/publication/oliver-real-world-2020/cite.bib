 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Psychosis Polyrisk Score (PPS) is a potential biomarker integrating non-purely genetic risk/protective factors for psychosis that may improve  identification of individuals at risk and prediction of their outcomes at the  individual subject level. Biomarkers that are easy to administer are direly needed  in early psychosis to facilitate clinical implementation. This study digitally  implements the PPS and pilots its feasibility of use in the real world. METHODS: The  PPS was implemented digitally and prospectively piloted across individuals referred  for a CHR-P assessment (n = 16) and healthy controls (n = 66). Distribution of PPS  scores was further simulated in the general population. RESULTS: 98.8% of  individuals referred for a CHR-P assessment and healthy controls completed the PPS  assessment with only one drop-out. 96.3% of participants completed the assessment in  under 15 min. Individuals referred for a CHR-P assessment had high PPS scores  (mean = 6.2, SD = 7.23) than healthy controls (mean = -1.79, SD = 6.78, p \textless 0.001).  In simulated general population data, scores were normally distributed ranging from  -15 (lowest risk, RR = 0.03) to 39.5 (highest risk, RR = 8912.51). DISCUSSION: The  PPS is a promising biomarker which has been implemented digitally. The PPS can be  easily administered to both healthy controls and individuals at potential risk for  psychosis on a range of devices. It is feasible to use the PPS in real world  settings to assess individuals with emerging mental disorders. The next phase of  research should be to include the PPS in large-scale international cohort studies to  evaluate its ability to refine the prognostication of outcomes.},
