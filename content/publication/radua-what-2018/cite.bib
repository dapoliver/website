 abstract = {Psychosis is a heterogeneous psychiatric condition for which a multitude of risk and protective factors have been suggested. This umbrella review aimed to classify the  strength of evidence for the associations between each factor and psychotic  disorders whilst controlling for several biases. The Web of Knowledge database was  searched to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies  which examined associations between socio-demographic, parental, perinatal, later  factors or antecedents and psychotic disorders, and which included a comparison  group of healthy controls, published from 1965 to January 31, 2017. The literature  search and data extraction followed PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. The association  between each factor and ICD or DSM diagnoses of non-organic psychotic disorders was  graded into convincing, highly suggestive, suggestive, weak, or non-significant  according to a standardized classification based on: number of psychotic cases,  random-effects p value, largest study 95% confidence interval, heterogeneity between  studies, 95% prediction interval, small study effect, and excess significance bias.  In order to assess evidence for temporality of association, we also conducted  sensitivity analyses restricted to data from prospective studies. Fifty-five  meta-analyses or systematic reviews were included in the umbrella review,  corresponding to 683 individual studies and 170 putative risk or protective factors  for psychotic disorders. Only the ultra-high-risk state for psychosis (odds ratio,  OR=9.32, 95% CI: 4.91-17.72) and Black-Caribbean ethnicity in England (OR=4.87, 95%  CI: 3.96-6.00) showed convincing evidence of association. Six factors were highly  suggestive (ethnic minority in low ethnic density area, second generation  immigrants, trait anhedonia, premorbid IQ, minor physical anomalies, and olfactory  identification ability), and nine were suggestive (urbanicity, ethnic minority in  high ethnic density area, first generation immigrants, North-African immigrants in  Europe, winter/spring season of birth in Northern hemisphere, childhood social  withdrawal, childhood trauma, Toxoplasma gondii IgG, and non-right handedness). When  only prospective studies were considered, the evidence was convincing for  ultra-high-risk state and suggestive for urbanicity only. In summary, this umbrella  review found several factors to be associated with psychotic disorders with  different levels of evidence. These risk or protective factors represent a starting  point for further etiopathological research and for the improvement of the  prediction of psychosis.},
