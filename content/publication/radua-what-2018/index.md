abstract: 'Psychosis is a heterogeneous psychiatric condition for which a multitude
  of risk and protective factors have been suggested. This umbrella review aimed to
  classify the  strength of evidence for the associations between each factor and
  psychotic  disorders whilst controlling for several biases. The Web of Knowledge
  database was  searched to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational
  studies  which examined associations between socio-demographic, parental, perinatal,
  later  factors or antecedents and psychotic disorders, and which included a comparison  group
  of healthy controls, published from 1965 to January 31, 2017. The literature  search
  and data extraction followed PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. The association  between
  each factor and ICD or DSM diagnoses of non-organic psychotic disorders was  graded
  into convincing, highly suggestive, suggestive, weak, or non-significant  according
  to a standardized classification based on: number of psychotic cases,  random-effects
  p value, largest study 95% confidence interval, heterogeneity between  studies,
  95% prediction interval, small study effect, and excess significance bias.  In order
  to assess evidence for temporality of association, we also conducted  sensitivity
  analyses restricted to data from prospective studies. Fifty-five  meta-analyses
  or systematic reviews were included in the umbrella review,  corresponding to 683
  individual studies and 170 putative risk or protective factors  for psychotic disorders.
  Only the ultra-high-risk state for psychosis (odds ratio,  OR=9.32, 95% CI: 4.91-17.72)
  and Black-Caribbean ethnicity in England (OR=4.87, 95%  CI: 3.96-6.00) showed convincing
  evidence of association. Six factors were highly  suggestive (ethnic minority in
  low ethnic density area, second generation  immigrants, trait anhedonia, premorbid
  IQ, minor physical anomalies, and olfactory  identification ability), and nine were
  suggestive (urbanicity, ethnic minority in  high ethnic density area, first generation
  immigrants, North-African immigrants in  Europe, winter/spring season of birth in
  Northern hemisphere, childhood social  withdrawal, childhood trauma, Toxoplasma
  gondii IgG, and non-right handedness). When  only prospective studies were considered,
  the evidence was convincing for  ultra-high-risk state and suggestive for urbanicity
  only. In summary, this umbrella  review found several factors to be associated with
  psychotic disorders with  different levels of evidence. These risk or protective
  factors represent a starting  point for further etiopathological research and for
  the improvement of the  prediction of psychosis.'
