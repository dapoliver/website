 abstract = {Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction (i.e., increased sympathetic and/or decreased parasympathetic activity) has been proposed to contribute to psychosis  vulnerability. Yet, we still lack directed therapeutic strategies that improve ANS  regulation in psychosis or at-risk states. The oxytocin system constitutes a  potential therapeutic target, given its role in ANS regulation. However, whether  intranasal oxytocin ameliorates autonomic regulation during emerging psychosis is  currently unknown. We pooled together two datasets, one of 30 men at clinical high  risk for psychosis (CHR-P), and another of 17 healthy men, who had participated in  two double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomised, crossover MRI studies with  similar protocols. All participants self-administered 40 IU of intranasal oxytocin  or placebo using a nasal spray. We recorded pulse plethysmography during a period of  8 min at about 1 h post dosing and estimated heart rate (HR) and high-frequency HR  variability (HF-HRV), an index of cardio-parasympathetic activity. CHR-P and healthy  men did not differ at resting HR or HF-HRV under placebo. We found a significant  condition × treatment effect for HF-HRV, showing that intranasal oxytocin, compared  with placebo, increased HF-HRV in CHR-P but not in healthy men. The main effects of  treatment and condition were not significant. In this proof-of-concept study, we  show that intranasal oxytocin increases cardio-parasympathetic activity in CHR-P  men, highlighting its therapeutic potential to improve autonomic regulation in this  clinical group. Our findings support the need for further research on the preventive  and therapeutic potential of intranasal oxytocin during emerging psychosis, where we  lack effective treatments.},
