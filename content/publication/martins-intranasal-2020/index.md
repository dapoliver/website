abstract: Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction (i.e., increased sympathetic
  and/or decreased parasympathetic activity) has been proposed to contribute to psychosis  vulnerability.
  Yet, we still lack directed therapeutic strategies that improve ANS  regulation
  in psychosis or at-risk states. The oxytocin system constitutes a  potential therapeutic
  target, given its role in ANS regulation. However, whether  intranasal oxytocin
  ameliorates autonomic regulation during emerging psychosis is  currently unknown.
  We pooled together two datasets, one of 30 men at clinical high  risk for psychosis
  (CHR-P), and another of 17 healthy men, who had participated in  two double-blinded,
  placebo-controlled, randomised, crossover MRI studies with  similar protocols. All
  participants self-administered 40 IU of intranasal oxytocin  or placebo using a
  nasal spray. We recorded pulse plethysmography during a period of  8 min at about
  1 h post dosing and estimated heart rate (HR) and high-frequency HR  variability
  (HF-HRV), an index of cardio-parasympathetic activity. CHR-P and healthy  men did
  not differ at resting HR or HF-HRV under placebo. We found a significant  condition × treatment
  effect for HF-HRV, showing that intranasal oxytocin, compared  with placebo, increased
  HF-HRV in CHR-P but not in healthy men. The main effects of  treatment and condition
  were not significant. In this proof-of-concept study, we  show that intranasal oxytocin
  increases cardio-parasympathetic activity in CHR-P  men, highlighting its therapeutic
  potential to improve autonomic regulation in this  clinical group. Our findings
  support the need for further research on the preventive  and therapeutic potential
  of intranasal oxytocin during emerging psychosis, where we  lack effective treatments.
