 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Little is known about clinical outcomes other than transition to psychosis in people at Clinical High-Risk for psychosis (CHR-P). Our aim was to  comprehensively meta-analytically evaluate for the first time a wide range of  clinical and functional outcomes beyond transition to psychosis in CHR-P  individuals. METHODS: PubMed and Web of Science were searched until November 2020 in  this PRISMA compliant meta-analysis (PROSPERO:CRD42020206271). Individual  longitudinal studies conducted in individuals at CHR-P providing data on at least  one of our outcomes of interest were included. We carried out random-effects  pairwise meta-analyses, meta-regressions, and assessed publication bias and study  quality. Analyses were two-tailed with α=0.05. FINDINGS: 75 prospective studies were  included (n=5,288, age=20.0 years, females=44.5%). Attenuated positive symptoms  improved at 12 (Hedges' g=0.753, 95%CI=0.495-1.012) and 24 (Hedges' g=0.836,  95%CI=0.463-1.209), but not ≥36 months (Hedges' g=0.315. 95%CI=-0.176-0.806).  Negative symptoms improved at 12 (Hedges' g=0.496, 95%CI=0.315-0.678), but not 24  (Hedges' g=0.499, 95%CI=-0.137-1.134) or ≥36 months (Hedges' g=0.033,  95%CI=-0.439-0.505). Depressive symptoms improved at 12 (Hedges' g=0.611,  95%CI=0.441-0.782) and 24 (Hedges' g=0.583, 95%CI=0.364-0.803), but not ≥36 months  (Hedges' g=0.512 95%CI=-0.337-1.361). Functioning improved at 12 (Hedges' g=0.711,  95%CI=0.488-0.934), 24 (Hedges' g=0.930, 95%CI=0.553-1.306) and ≥36 months (Hedges'  g=0.392, 95%CI=0.117-0.667). Remission from CHR-P status occurred in 33.4%  (95%CI=22.6-44.1%) at 12 months, 41.4% (95%CI=32.3-50.5%) at 24 months and 42.4%  (95%CI=23.4-61.3%) at ≥36 months. Heterogeneity across the included studies was  significant and ranged from I(2)=53.6% to I(2)=96.9%. The quality of the included  studies (mean±SD) was 4.6±1.1 (range=2-8). INTERPRETATION: CHR-P individuals improve  on symptomatic and functional outcomes over time, but these improvements are not  maintained in the longer term, and less than half fully remit. Prolonged duration of  care may be needed for this patient population to optimize outcomes. FUNDING: None.},
