abstract: Alterations in neurochemical metabolites are thought to play a role in the
  pathophysiology of psychosis onset. Oxytocin, a neuropeptide with prosocial and  anxiolytic
  properties, modulates glutamate neurotransmission in preclinical models  but its
  neurochemical effects in people at high risk for psychosis are unknown. We  used
  proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) to examine the effects of  intranasal
  oxytocin on glutamate and other metabolites in people at Clinical High  Risk for
  Psychosis (CHR-P) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design.  30 CHR-P
  males were studied on two occasions, once after 40IU intranasal oxytocin  and once
  after placebo. The effects of oxytocin on the concentration of glutamate,  glutamate+glutamine
  and other metabolites (choline, N-acetylaspartate, myo-inositol)  scaled to creatine
  were examined in the left thalamus, anterior cingulate cortex  (ACC) and left hippocampus,
  starting approximately 75, 84 and 93 min post-dosing,  respectively. Relative to
  placebo, administration of oxytocin was associated with an  increase in choline
  levels in the ACC (p=.008, Cohen's d = 0.54). There were no  other significant effects
  on metabolite concentrations (all ptextgreater.05). Our findings  suggest that,
  at ∼75-99 min post-dosing, a single dose of intranasal oxytocin does  not alter
  levels of neurochemical metabolites in the thalamus, ACC, or hippocampus  in those
  at CHR-P, aside from potential effects on choline in the ACC.
