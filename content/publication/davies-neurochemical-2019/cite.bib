 abstract = {Alterations in neurochemical metabolites are thought to play a role in the pathophysiology of psychosis onset. Oxytocin, a neuropeptide with prosocial and  anxiolytic properties, modulates glutamate neurotransmission in preclinical models  but its neurochemical effects in people at high risk for psychosis are unknown. We  used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) to examine the effects of  intranasal oxytocin on glutamate and other metabolites in people at Clinical High  Risk for Psychosis (CHR-P) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design.  30 CHR-P males were studied on two occasions, once after 40IU intranasal oxytocin  and once after placebo. The effects of oxytocin on the concentration of glutamate,  glutamate+glutamine and other metabolites (choline, N-acetylaspartate, myo-inositol)  scaled to creatine were examined in the left thalamus, anterior cingulate cortex  (ACC) and left hippocampus, starting approximately 75, 84 and 93 min post-dosing,  respectively. Relative to placebo, administration of oxytocin was associated with an  increase in choline levels in the ACC (p=.008, Cohen's d = 0.54). There were no  other significant effects on metabolite concentrations (all p\textgreater.05). Our findings  suggest that, at ∼75-99 min post-dosing, a single dose of intranasal oxytocin does  not alter levels of neurochemical metabolites in the thalamus, ACC, or hippocampus  in those at CHR-P, aside from potential effects on choline in the ACC.},
