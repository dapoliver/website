abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Formal thought disorder is a cardinal feature of psychotic
  disorders, and is also evident in subtle forms before psychosis onset in individuals
  at  clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR-P). Assessing speech output or assessing  expressive
  language with speech as the medium at this stage may be particularly  useful in
  predicting later transition to psychosis. METHOD: Speech samples were  acquired
  through administration of the Thought and Language Index (TLI) in 24 CHR-P  participants,
  16 people with first-episode psychosis (FEP) and 13 healthy controls.  The CHR-P
  individuals were then followed clinically for a mean of 7 years  (s.d. = 1.5) to
  determine if they transitioned to psychosis. Non-semantic speech  graph analysis
  was used to assess the connectedness of transcribed speech in all  groups. RESULTS:
  Speech was significantly more disconnected in the FEP group than in  both healthy
  controls (p textless .01) and the CHR-P group (p textless .05). Results remained  significant
  when IQ was included as a covariate. Significant correlations were found  between
  speech connectedness measures and scores on the TLI, a manual assessment of  formal
  thought disorder. In the CHR-P group, lower scores on two measures of speech  connectedness
  were associated with subsequent transition to psychosis (8  transitions, 16 non-transitions;
  p textless .05). CONCLUSION: These findings support the  utility and validity of
  speech graph analysis methods in characterizing speech  connectedness in the early
  phases of psychosis. This approach has the potential to  be developed into an automated,
  objective and time-efficient way of stratifying  individuals at CHR-P according
  to level of psychosis risk.'
