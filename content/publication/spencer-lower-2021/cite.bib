 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Formal thought disorder is a cardinal feature of psychotic disorders, and is also evident in subtle forms before psychosis onset in individuals at  clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR-P). Assessing speech output or assessing  expressive language with speech as the medium at this stage may be particularly  useful in predicting later transition to psychosis. METHOD: Speech samples were  acquired through administration of the Thought and Language Index (TLI) in 24 CHR-P  participants, 16 people with first-episode psychosis (FEP) and 13 healthy controls.  The CHR-P individuals were then followed clinically for a mean of 7 years  (s.d. = 1.5) to determine if they transitioned to psychosis. Non-semantic speech  graph analysis was used to assess the connectedness of transcribed speech in all  groups. RESULTS: Speech was significantly more disconnected in the FEP group than in  both healthy controls (p \textless .01) and the CHR-P group (p \textless .05). Results remained  significant when IQ was included as a covariate. Significant correlations were found  between speech connectedness measures and scores on the TLI, a manual assessment of  formal thought disorder. In the CHR-P group, lower scores on two measures of speech  connectedness were associated with subsequent transition to psychosis (8  transitions, 16 non-transitions; p \textless .05). CONCLUSION: These findings support the  utility and validity of speech graph analysis methods in characterizing speech  connectedness in the early phases of psychosis. This approach has the potential to  be developed into an automated, objective and time-efficient way of stratifying  individuals at CHR-P according to level of psychosis risk.},
