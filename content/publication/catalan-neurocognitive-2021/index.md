abstract: 'IMPORTANCE: Neurocognitive functioning is a potential biomarker to advance
  detection, prognosis, and preventive care for individuals at clinical high risk
  for  psychosis (CHR-P). The current consistency and magnitude of neurocognitive  functioning
  in individuals at CHR-P are undetermined. OBJECTIVE: To provide an  updated synthesis
  of evidence on the consistency and magnitude of neurocognitive  functioning in individuals
  at CHR-P. DATA SOURCES: Web of Science database, Cochrane  Central Register of Reviews,
  and Ovid/PsycINFO and trial registries up to July 1,  2020. STUDY SELECTION: Multistep
  literature search compliant with Preferred  Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
  and Meta-analyses and Meta-analysis of  Observational Studies in Epidemiology performed
  by independent researchers to  identify original studies reporting on neurocognitive
  functioning in individuals at  CHR-P. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Independent
  researchers extracted the data,  clustering the neurocognitive tasks according to
  7 Measurement and Treatment  Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS)
  domains and 8 CHR-P  domains. Random-effect model meta-analyses, assessment of publication
  biases and  study quality, and meta-regressions were conducted. MAIN OUTCOMES AND
  MEASURES: The  primary effect size measure was Hedges g of neurocognitive functioning
  in  individuals at CHR-P (1) compared with healthy control (HC) individuals or (2)  compared
  with individuals with first-episode psychosis (FEP) or (3) stratified for  the longitudinal
  transition to psychosis. RESULTS: A total of 78 independent studies  were included,
  consisting of 5162 individuals at CHR-P (mean [SD; range] age, 20.2  [3.3; 12.0-29.0]
  years; 2529 [49.0%] were female), 2865 HC individuals (mean [SD;  range] age, 21.1
  [3.6; 12.6-29.2] years; 1490 [52.0%] were female), and 486  individuals with FEP
  (mean [SD; range] age, 23.0 [2.0; 19.1-26.4] years; 267 [55.9%]  were female). Compared
  with HC individuals, individuals at CHR-P showed medium to  large deficits on the
  Stroop color word reading task (g = -1.17; 95% CI, -1.86 to  -0.48), Hopkins Verbal
  Learning Test-Revised (g = -0.86; 95% CI, -1.43 to -0.28),  digit symbol coding
  test (g = -0.74; 95% CI, -1.19 to -0.29), Brief Assessment of  Cognition Scale Symbol
  Coding (g = -0.67; 95% CI, -0.95 to -0.39), University of  Pennsylvania Smell Identification
  Test (g = -0.55; 95% CI, -0.97 to -0.12), Hinting  Task (g = -0.53; 95% CI, -0.77
  to -0.28), Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test  (g = -0.50; 95% CI, -0.78 to -0.21),
  California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT)  (g = -0.50; 95% CI, -0.64 to -0.36), and
  National Adult Reading Test (g = -0.52; 95%  CI, -1.01 to -0.03). Individuals at
  CHR-P were less impaired than individuals with  FEP. Longitudinal transition to
  psychosis from a CHR-P state was associated with  medium to large deficits in the
  CVLT task (g = -0.58; 95% CI, -1.12 to -0.05).  Meta-regressions found significant
  effects for age and education on processing  speed. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Findings
  from this meta-analysis support  neurocognitive dysfunction as a potential detection
  and prognostic biomarker in  individuals at CHR-P. These findings may advance clinical
  research and inform  preventive approaches.'
