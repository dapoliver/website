abstract: "BACKGROUND: The diagnostic and prognostic significance of the DSM-5-defined\
  \ Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome (DSM-5-APS) in individuals undergoing an ultra high\
  \  risk (UHR) clinical assessment for suspicion of psychosis risk is unknown. METHODS:\
  \  Prospective cohort study including all consecutive help-seeking individuals \
  \ undergoing both a DSM-5-APS and a Comprehensive Assessment of At Risk Mental States\
  \  (CAARMS 12/2006) assessment for psychosis risk at the Outreach and Support in\
  \ South  London (OASIS) UHR service (March 2013-April 2014). The diagnostic significance\
  \ of  DSM-5-APS was assessed with percent overall agreement, prevalence bias adjusted\
  \  kappa, Bowker's test, Stuart-Maxwell test, residual analysis; the prognostic\
  \  significance with Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier failure function, time-dependent\
  \ area  under the curve (AUC) and net benefits analysis. The impact of specific\
  \ revisions of  the DSM-5-APS was further tested. RESULT: In 203 help-seeking individuals\
  \ undergoing  UHR assessment, the agreement between the DSM-5-APS and the CAARMS\
  \ 12/2006 was only  moderate (kappa 0.59). Among 142 nonpsychotic cases, those meeting\
  \ DSM-5-APS  criteria had a 5-fold probability (HR = 5.379) of developing psychosis\
  \ compared to  those not meeting DSM-5-APS criteria, with a 21-month cumulative\
  \ risk of psychosis  of 28.17% vs 6.49%, respectively. The DSM-5-APS prognostic\
  \ accuracy was acceptable  (AUC 0.76 at 24 months) and similar to the CAARMS 12/2006.\
  \ The DSM-5-APS designation  may be clinically useful to guide the provision of\
  \ indicated interventions within a  7%-35% (2-year) range of psychosis risk. The\
  \ removal of the criterion E or C of the  DSM-5-APS may improve its prognostic performance\
  \ and transdiagnostic value.  CONCLUSIONS: The DSM-5-APS designation may be clinically\
  \ useful in individuals  accessing clinical services for psychosis prevention."
