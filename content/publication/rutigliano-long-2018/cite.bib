 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute and transient psychotic disorders (ATPD) are characterized by an acute onset and a remitting course, and overlap with subgroups of the clinical  high-risk state for psychosis. The long-term course and outcomes of ATPD are not  completely clear. METHODS: Electronic health record-based retrospective cohort  study, including all patients who received a first index diagnosis of ATPD (F23,  ICD-10) within the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) National Health Service Trust,  between 1 st April 2006 and 15th June 2017. The primary outcome was risk of  developing persistent psychotic disorders, defined as the development of any ICD-10  diagnoses of non-organic psychotic disorders. Cumulative risk of psychosis onset was  estimated through Kaplan-Meier failure functions (non-competing risks) and Greenwood  confidence intervals. RESULTS: A total of 3074 patients receiving a first index  diagnosis of ATPD (F23, ICD-10) within SLaM were included. The mean follow-up was  1495 days. After 8-year, 1883 cases (61.26%) retained the index diagnosis of ATPD;  the remaining developed psychosis. The cumulative incidence (Kaplan-Meier failure  function) of risk of developing any ICD-10 non-organic psychotic disorder was 16.10%  at 1-year (95%CI 14.83-17.47%), 28.41% at 2-year (95%CI 26.80-30.09%), 33.96% at  3-year (95% CI 32.25-35.75%), 36.85% at 4-year (95%CI 35.07-38.69%), 40.99% at  5-year (95% CI 39.12-42.92%), 42.58% at 6-year (95%CI 40.67-44.55%), 44.65% at  7-year (95% CI 42.66-46.69%), and 46.25% at 8-year (95% CI 44.17-48.37%). The  cumulative risk of schizophrenia-spectrum disorder at 8-year was 36.14% (95% CI  34.09-38.27%). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with ATPD have a very high risk of  developing persistent psychotic disorders and may benefit from early detection and  preventive treatments to improve their outcomes.},
