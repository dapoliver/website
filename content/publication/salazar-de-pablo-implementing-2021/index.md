abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The impact of precision psychiatry for clinical practice has
  not been systematically appraised. This study aims to provide a comprehensive review
  of  validated prediction models to estimate the individual risk of being affected
  with a  condition (diagnostic), developing outcomes (prognostic), or responding
  to  treatments (predictive) in mental disorders. METHODS: PRISMA/RIGHT/CHARMS-compliant  systematic
  review of the Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Reviews, and  Ovid/PsycINFO
  databases from inception until July 21, 2019 (PROSPERO CRD42019155713)  to identify
  diagnostic/prognostic/predictive prediction studies that reported  individualized
  estimates in psychiatry and that were internally or externally  validated or implemented.
  Random effect meta-regression analyses addressed the  impact of several factors
  on the accuracy of prediction models. FINDINGS: Literature  search identified 584
  prediction modeling studies, of which 89 were included. 10.4%  of the total studies
  included prediction models internally validated (n = 61), 4.6%  models externally
  validated (n = 27), and 0.2% (n = 1) models considered for  implementation. Across
  validated prediction modeling studies (n = 88), 18.2% were  diagnostic, 68.2% prognostic,
  and 13.6% predictive. The most frequently investigated  condition was psychosis
  (36.4%), and the most frequently employed predictors  clinical (69.5%). Unimodal
  compared to multimodal models (β = .29, P = .03) and  diagnostic compared to prognostic
  (β = .84, p textless .0001) and predictive (β = .87, P =  .002) models were associated
  with increased accuracy. INTERPRETATION: To date,  several validated prediction
  models are available to support the diagnosis and  prognosis of psychiatric conditions,
  in particular, psychosis, or to predict  treatment response. Advancements of knowledge
  are limited by the lack of  implementation research in real-world clinical practice.
  A new generation of  implementation research is required to address this translational
  gap.'
