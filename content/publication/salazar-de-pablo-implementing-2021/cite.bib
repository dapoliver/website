 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The impact of precision psychiatry for clinical practice has not been systematically appraised. This study aims to provide a comprehensive review of  validated prediction models to estimate the individual risk of being affected with a  condition (diagnostic), developing outcomes (prognostic), or responding to  treatments (predictive) in mental disorders. METHODS: PRISMA/RIGHT/CHARMS-compliant  systematic review of the Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Reviews, and  Ovid/PsycINFO databases from inception until July 21, 2019 (PROSPERO CRD42019155713)  to identify diagnostic/prognostic/predictive prediction studies that reported  individualized estimates in psychiatry and that were internally or externally  validated or implemented. Random effect meta-regression analyses addressed the  impact of several factors on the accuracy of prediction models. FINDINGS: Literature  search identified 584 prediction modeling studies, of which 89 were included. 10.4%  of the total studies included prediction models internally validated (n = 61), 4.6%  models externally validated (n = 27), and 0.2% (n = 1) models considered for  implementation. Across validated prediction modeling studies (n = 88), 18.2% were  diagnostic, 68.2% prognostic, and 13.6% predictive. The most frequently investigated  condition was psychosis (36.4%), and the most frequently employed predictors  clinical (69.5%). Unimodal compared to multimodal models (β = .29, P = .03) and  diagnostic compared to prognostic (β = .84, p \textless .0001) and predictive (β = .87, P =  .002) models were associated with increased accuracy. INTERPRETATION: To date,  several validated prediction models are available to support the diagnosis and  prognosis of psychiatric conditions, in particular, psychosis, or to predict  treatment response. Advancements of knowledge are limited by the lack of  implementation research in real-world clinical practice. A new generation of  implementation research is required to address this translational gap.},
