abstract: "Recent studies have shown that an automated, lifespan-inclusive, transdiagnostic,\
  \ and clinically based, individualized risk calculator provides a powerful system\
  \ for  supporting the early detection of individuals at-risk of psychosis at a large\
  \ scale,  by leveraging electronic health records (EHRs). This risk calculator has\
  \ been  externally validated twice and is undergoing feasibility testing for clinical\
  \  implementation. Integration of this risk calculator in clinical routine should\
  \ be  facilitated by prospective feasibility studies, which are required to address\
  \  pragmatic challenges, such as missing data, and the usability of this risk  calculator\
  \ in a real-world and routine clinical setting. Here, we present an  approach for\
  \ a prospective implementation of a real-time psychosis risk detection  and alerting\
  \ service in a real-world EHR system. This method leverages the CogStack  platform,\
  \ which is an open-source, lightweight, and distributed information  retrieval and\
  \ text extraction system. The CogStack platform incorporates a set of  services\
  \ that allow for full-text search of clinical data, lifespan-inclusive,  real-time\
  \ calculation of psychosis risk, early risk-alerting to clinicians, and the  visual\
  \ monitoring of patients over time. Our method includes: 1) ingestion and  synchronization\
  \ of data from multiple sources into the CogStack platform, 2)  implementation of\
  \ a risk calculator, whose algorithm was previously developed and  validated, for\
  \ timely computation of a patient's risk of psychosis, 3) creation of  interactive\
  \ visualizations and dashboards to monitor patients' health status over  time, and\
  \ 4) building automated alerting systems to ensure that clinicians are  notified\
  \ of patients at-risk, so that appropriate actions can be pursued. This is  the\
  \ first ever study that has developed and implemented a similar detection and  alerting\
  \ system in clinical routine for early detection of psychosis."
