 abstract = {Recent studies have shown that an automated, lifespan-inclusive, transdiagnostic, and clinically based, individualized risk calculator provides a powerful system for  supporting the early detection of individuals at-risk of psychosis at a large scale,  by leveraging electronic health records (EHRs). This risk calculator has been  externally validated twice and is undergoing feasibility testing for clinical  implementation. Integration of this risk calculator in clinical routine should be  facilitated by prospective feasibility studies, which are required to address  pragmatic challenges, such as missing data, and the usability of this risk  calculator in a real-world and routine clinical setting. Here, we present an  approach for a prospective implementation of a real-time psychosis risk detection  and alerting service in a real-world EHR system. This method leverages the CogStack  platform, which is an open-source, lightweight, and distributed information  retrieval and text extraction system. The CogStack platform incorporates a set of  services that allow for full-text search of clinical data, lifespan-inclusive,  real-time calculation of psychosis risk, early risk-alerting to clinicians, and the  visual monitoring of patients over time. Our method includes: 1) ingestion and  synchronization of data from multiple sources into the CogStack platform, 2)  implementation of a risk calculator, whose algorithm was previously developed and  validated, for timely computation of a patient's risk of psychosis, 3) creation of  interactive visualizations and dashboards to monitor patients' health status over  time, and 4) building automated alerting systems to ensure that clinicians are  notified of patients at-risk, so that appropriate actions can be pursued. This is  the first ever study that has developed and implemented a similar detection and  alerting system in clinical routine for early detection of psychosis.},
