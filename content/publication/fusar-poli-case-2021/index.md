abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Improving outcomes of a First Episode of Psychosis (FEP) relies
  on the ability to detect most individuals with emerging psychosis and treat them
  in  specialised Early Intervention (EI) services. Efficacy of current detection  strategies
  is undetermined. METHODS: RECORD-compliant clinical, 6-year,  retrospective, transdiagnostic,
  lifespan-inclusive, Electronic Health Record (EHR)  cohort study, representing real-world
  secondary mental healthcare in South London  and Maudsley (SLaM) NHS. All individuals
  accessing SLaM in the period 2007-2017 and  receiving any ICD-10 diagnosis other
  than persistent psychosis were included.  Descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier curves,
  logistic regression, epidemiological  incidence of psychosis in the general population
  were used to address pathways to  care and detection power of EI services for FEP.
  RESULTS: A total of 106,706  individuals underwent the 6-year follow-up: they were
  mostly single (72.57%) males  (50.51%) of white ethnicity (60.01%), aged on average
  32.96 years, with an average  Health Of the Nation Outcome Scale score of 11.12
  and mostly affected with F40-48  Neurotic/stress-related/somatoform disorders (27.46%).
  Their transdiagnostic risk of  developing a FEP cumulated to 0.072 (95%CI 0.067-0.077)
  at 6 years. Those  individuals who developed a FEP (n = 1841) entered healthcare
  mostly (79.02%)  through inpatient mental health services (29.76%), community mental
  health services  (29.54%) or accident and emergency departments (19.50%); at the
  time of FEP onset,  most of them (46.43%) were under the acute care pathway. Individuals
  contacting  accident and emergency departments had an increased risk of FEP (OR
  2.301, 95%CI  2.095-2.534, P textless 0.001). The proportion of SLaM FEP cases that
  were eligible and  under the care of EI services was 0.456 at any time. The epidemiological
  proportion  of FEP cases in the sociodemographically-matched general population
  that was  detected by EI service was 0.373. CONCLUSIONS: More than half of individuals
  who  develop a FEP remain undetected by current pathways to care and EI services.  Improving
  detection strategies should become a mainstream area in the future  generation of
  early psychosis research.'
