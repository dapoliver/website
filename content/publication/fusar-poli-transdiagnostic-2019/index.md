abstract: "BACKGROUND: The benefits of indicated primary prevention among individuals\
  \ at Clinical High Risk for Psychosis (CHR-P) are limited by the difficulty in detecting\
  \  these individuals. To overcome this problem, a transdiagnostic, clinically based,\
  \  individualized risk calculator has recently been developed and subjected to a\
  \ first  external validation in 2 different catchment areas of the South London\
  \ and Maudsley  (SLaM) NHS Trust. METHODS: Second external validation of real world,\
  \ real-time  electronic clinical register-based cohort study. All individuals who\
  \ received a  first ICD-10 index diagnosis of nonorganic and nonpsychotic mental\
  \ disorder within  the Camden and Islington (C&I) NHS Trust between 2009 and 2016\
  \ were included. The  model previously validated included age, gender, ethnicity,\
  \ age by gender, and  ICD-10 index diagnosis to predict the development of any ICD-10\
  \ nonorganic  psychosis. The model's performance was measured using Harrell's C-index.\
  \ RESULTS:  This study included a total of 13702 patients with an average age of\
  \ 40 (range  16-99), 52% were female, and most were of white ethnicity (64%). There\
  \ were no CHR-P  or child/adolescent services in the C&I Trust. The C&I and SLaM\
  \ Trust samples also  differed significantly in terms of age, gender, ethnicity,\
  \ and distribution of index  diagnosis. Despite these significant differences, the\
  \ original model retained an  acceptable predictive performance (Harrell's C of\
  \ 0.73), which is comparable to that  of CHR-P tools currently recommended for clinical\
  \ use. CONCLUSIONS: This risk  calculator may pragmatically support an improved\
  \ transdiagnostic detection of  at-risk individuals and psychosis prediction even\
  \ in NHS Trusts in the United  Kingdom where CHR-P services are not provided."
