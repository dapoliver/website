 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The benefits of indicated primary prevention among individuals at Clinical High Risk for Psychosis (CHR-P) are limited by the difficulty in detecting  these individuals. To overcome this problem, a transdiagnostic, clinically based,  individualized risk calculator has recently been developed and subjected to a first  external validation in 2 different catchment areas of the South London and Maudsley  (SLaM) NHS Trust. METHODS: Second external validation of real world, real-time  electronic clinical register-based cohort study. All individuals who received a  first ICD-10 index diagnosis of nonorganic and nonpsychotic mental disorder within  the Camden and Islington (C&I) NHS Trust between 2009 and 2016 were included. The  model previously validated included age, gender, ethnicity, age by gender, and  ICD-10 index diagnosis to predict the development of any ICD-10 nonorganic  psychosis. The model's performance was measured using Harrell's C-index. RESULTS:  This study included a total of 13702 patients with an average age of 40 (range  16-99), 52% were female, and most were of white ethnicity (64%). There were no CHR-P  or child/adolescent services in the C&I Trust. The C&I and SLaM Trust samples also  differed significantly in terms of age, gender, ethnicity, and distribution of index  diagnosis. Despite these significant differences, the original model retained an  acceptable predictive performance (Harrell's C of 0.73), which is comparable to that  of CHR-P tools currently recommended for clinical use. CONCLUSIONS: This risk  calculator may pragmatically support an improved transdiagnostic detection of  at-risk individuals and psychosis prediction even in NHS Trusts in the United  Kingdom where CHR-P services are not provided.},
