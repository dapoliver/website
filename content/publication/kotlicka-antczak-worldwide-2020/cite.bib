 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical research into the Clinical High Risk state for Psychosis (CHR-P) has allowed primary indicated prevention in psychiatry to improve outcomes  of psychotic disorders. The strategic component of this approach is the  implementation of clinical services to detect and take care of CHR-P individuals,  which are recommended by several guidelines. The actual level of implementation of  CHR-P services worldwide is not completely clear. AIM: To assess the global  geographical distribution, core characteristics relating to the level of  implementation of CHR-P services; to overview of the main barriers that limit their  implementation at scale. METHODS: CHR-P services worldwide were invited to complete  an online survey. The survey addressed the geographical distribution, general  implementation characteristics and implementation barriers. RESULTS: The survey was  completed by 47 CHR-P services offering care to 22 248 CHR-P individuals: Western  Europe (51.1%), North America (17.0%), East Asia (17.0%), Australia (6.4%), South  America (6.4%) and Africa (2.1%). Their implementation characteristics included  heterogeneous clinical settings, assessment instruments and length of care offered.  Most CHR-P patients were recruited through mental or physical health services.  Preventive interventions included clinical monitoring and crisis management (80.1%),  supportive therapy (70.2%) or structured psychotherapy (61.7%), in combination with  pharmacological treatment (in 74.5%). Core implementation barriers were staffing and  financial constraints, and the recruitment of CHR-P individuals. The dynamic map of  CHR-P services has been implemented on the IEPA website:  https://iepa.org.au/list-a-service/. CONCLUSIONS: Worldwide primary indicated  prevention of psychosis in CHR-P individuals is possible, but the implementation of  CHR-P services is heterogeneous and constrained by pragmatic challenges.},
