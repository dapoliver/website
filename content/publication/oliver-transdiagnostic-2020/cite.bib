 abstract = {The real-world impact of psychosis prevention is reliant on effective strategies for identifying individuals at risk. A transdiagnostic, individualized, clinically-based  risk calculator to improve this has been developed and externally validated twice in  two different UK healthcare trusts with convincing results. The prognostic  performance of this risk calculator outside the UK is unknown. All individuals who  accessed primary or secondary health care services belonging to the IBM(®)  MarketScan(®) Commercial Database between January 2015 and December 2017, and  received a first ICD-10 index diagnosis of nonorganic/nonpsychotic mental disorder,  were included. According to the risk calculator, age, gender, ethnicity,  age-by-gender, and ICD-10 cluster diagnosis at index date were used to predict  development of any ICD-10 nonorganic psychotic disorder. Because patient-level  ethnicity data were not available city-level ethnicity proportions were used as  proxy. The study included 2,430,333 patients with a mean follow-up of 15.36 months  and cumulative incidence of psychosis at two years of 1.43%. There were profound  differences compared to the original development UK database in terms of case-mix,  psychosis incidence, distribution of baseline predictors (ICD-10 cluster diagnoses),  availability of patient-level ethnicity data, follow-up time and availability of  specialized clinical services for at-risk individuals. Despite these important  differences, the model retained accuracy significantly above chance (Harrell's  C = 0.676, 95% CI: 0.672-0.679). To date, this is the largest international external  replication of an individualized prognostic model in the field of psychiatry. This  risk calculator is transportable on an international scale to improve the automatic  detection of individuals at risk of psychosis.},
