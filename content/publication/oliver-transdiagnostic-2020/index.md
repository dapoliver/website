abstract: "The real-world impact of psychosis prevention is reliant on effective strategies\
  \ for identifying individuals at risk. A transdiagnostic, individualized, clinically-based\
  \  risk calculator to improve this has been developed and externally validated twice\
  \ in  two different UK healthcare trusts with convincing results. The prognostic\
  \  performance of this risk calculator outside the UK is unknown. All individuals\
  \ who  accessed primary or secondary health care services belonging to the IBM(®)\
  \  MarketScan(®) Commercial Database between January 2015 and December 2017, and\
  \  received a first ICD-10 index diagnosis of nonorganic/nonpsychotic mental disorder,\
  \  were included. According to the risk calculator, age, gender, ethnicity,  age-by-gender,\
  \ and ICD-10 cluster diagnosis at index date were used to predict  development of\
  \ any ICD-10 nonorganic psychotic disorder. Because patient-level  ethnicity data\
  \ were not available city-level ethnicity proportions were used as  proxy. The study\
  \ included 2,430,333 patients with a mean follow-up of 15.36 months  and cumulative\
  \ incidence of psychosis at two years of 1.43%. There were profound  differences\
  \ compared to the original development UK database in terms of case-mix,  psychosis\
  \ incidence, distribution of baseline predictors (ICD-10 cluster diagnoses),  availability\
  \ of patient-level ethnicity data, follow-up time and availability of  specialized\
  \ clinical services for at-risk individuals. Despite these important  differences,\
  \ the model retained accuracy significantly above chance (Harrell's  C = 0.676,\
  \ 95% CI: 0.672-0.679). To date, this is the largest international external  replication\
  \ of an individualized prognostic model in the field of psychiatry. This  risk calculator\
  \ is transportable on an international scale to improve the automatic  detection\
  \ of individuals at risk of psychosis."
