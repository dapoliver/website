 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with acute and transient psychotic disorders (ATPDs) are by definition remitting, but have a high risk of developing persistent psychoses,  resembling a subgroup of individuals at Clinical High Risk for Psychosis (CHR-P).  Their pathways to care, treatment offered and long-term clinical outcomes beyond  risk to psychosis are unexplored. We conducted an electronic health record-based  retrospective cohort study including patients with ATPDs within the SLaM NHS Trust  and followed-up to 8 years. METHODS: A total of 2561 ATPDs were included in the  study. A minority were detected (8%) and treated (18%) by Early Intervention  services (EIS) and none by CHR-P services. Patients were offered a clinical  follow-up of 350.40 ± 589.90 days. The cumulative incidence of discharges was 40% at  3 months, 60% at 1 year, 69% at 2 years, 77% at 4 years, and 82% at 8 years.  Treatment was heterogeneous: the majority of patients received antipsychotics (up to  52%), only a tiny minority psychotherapy (up to 8%). RESULTS: Over follow-up, 32.88%  and 28.54% of ATPDS received at least one mental health hospitalization or one  compulsory hospital admission under the Mental Health Act, respectively. The mean  number of days spent in psychiatric hospital was 66.39 ± 239.44 days. CONCLUSIONS:  The majority of ATPDs are not detected/treated by EIS or CHR-P services, receive  heterogeneous treatments and short-term clinical follow-up. ATPDs have a high risk  of developing severe clinical outcomes beyond persistent psychotic disorders and  unmet clinical needs that are not targeted by current mental health services.},
