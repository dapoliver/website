abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Patients with acute and transient psychotic disorders (ATPDs)
  are by definition remitting, but have a high risk of developing persistent psychoses,  resembling
  a subgroup of individuals at Clinical High Risk for Psychosis (CHR-P).  Their pathways
  to care, treatment offered and long-term clinical outcomes beyond  risk to psychosis
  are unexplored. We conducted an electronic health record-based  retrospective cohort
  study including patients with ATPDs within the SLaM NHS Trust  and followed-up to
  8 years. METHODS: A total of 2561 ATPDs were included in the  study. A minority
  were detected (8%) and treated (18%) by Early Intervention  services (EIS) and none
  by CHR-P services. Patients were offered a clinical  follow-up of 350.40 ± 589.90
  days. The cumulative incidence of discharges was 40% at  3 months, 60% at 1 year,
  69% at 2 years, 77% at 4 years, and 82% at 8 years.  Treatment was heterogeneous:
  the majority of patients received antipsychotics (up to  52%), only a tiny minority
  psychotherapy (up to 8%). RESULTS: Over follow-up, 32.88%  and 28.54% of ATPDS received
  at least one mental health hospitalization or one  compulsory hospital admission
  under the Mental Health Act, respectively. The mean  number of days spent in psychiatric
  hospital was 66.39 ± 239.44 days. CONCLUSIONS:  The majority of ATPDs are not detected/treated
  by EIS or CHR-P services, receive  heterogeneous treatments and short-term clinical
  follow-up. ATPDs have a high risk  of developing severe clinical outcomes beyond
  persistent psychotic disorders and  unmet clinical needs that are not targeted by
  current mental health services.'
