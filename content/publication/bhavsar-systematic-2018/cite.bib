 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Self-reported psychotic experiences (PEs) are associated with psychopathology of all kinds, not just psychoses. However, systematic reviews on the  relevance of this for health services are unavailable. Furthermore, whether  association with service use is confounded by other psychopathology is unknown, and  is relevant to prevention and treatment. OBJECTIVES: Literature examining  associations between PEs and service use was systematically reviewed. Study quality  and the direction and extent of any associations were assessed, and meta-analysis  conducted. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out as per  PRISMA guidelines. A search of electronic databases was performed based on free-text  and structured terms. Included studies were evaluated by two raters using a  structured tool and estimates extracted for reporting. RESULTS: Thirteen studies  were returned. We found two prospective studies, and a minority of studies accounted  for concurrent psychopathology, limiting our ability to test our main hypotheses.  Five studies reported associations by different types of service use. Almost all  studies assessed service use by self-report. Meta-analysis suggested that people who  reported PEs were around twice as likely to report service use compared to those who  did not (pooled OR for all included studies: 2.20,95% confidence intervals (95%CI):  1.66,2.91). CONCLUSIONS: There was consistent evidence of association between PEs  and mental health service use at the general population level. However, evidence for  causation was poor due to a limited number of studies. Whether increased service use  in this group is solely attributable to PEs, and therefore whether interventions  aimed at limiting/preventing PEs might be effective, requires studies focusing on  the relationships between PEs, psychopathology and service use.},
