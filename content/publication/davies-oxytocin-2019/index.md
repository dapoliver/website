abstract: Preclinical and human studies suggest that hippocampal dysfunction is a
  key factor in the onset of psychosis. People at Clinical High Risk for psychosis
  (CHR-P)  present with a clinical syndrome that can include social withdrawal and
  have a  20-35% risk of developing psychosis in the next 2 years. Recent research
  shows that  resting hippocampal blood flow is altered in CHR-P individuals and predicts
  adverse  clinical outcomes, such as non-remission/transition to frank psychosis.
  Previous  work in healthy males indicates that a single dose of intranasal oxytocin
  has  positive effects on social function and marked effects on resting hippocampal
  blood  flow. The present study examined the effects of intranasal oxytocin on hippocampal  blood
  flow in CHR-P individuals. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover  design,
  30 CHR-P males were studied using pseudo-continuous Arterial Spin Labelling  on
  2 occasions, once after 40IU intranasal oxytocin and once after placebo. The  effects
  of oxytocin on left hippocampal blood flow were examined in a  region-of-interest
  analysis of data acquired at 22-28 and at 30-36 minutes  post-intranasal administration.
  Relative to placebo, administration of oxytocin was  associated with increased hippocampal
  blood flow at both time points (p = .0056;  p = .034), although the effect at the
  second did not survive adjustment for the  effect of global blood flow. These data
  indicate that oxytocin can modulate  hippocampal function in CHR-P individuals and
  therefore merits further investigation  as a candidate novel treatment for this
  group.
