 abstract = {Preclinical and human studies suggest that hippocampal dysfunction is a key factor in the onset of psychosis. People at Clinical High Risk for psychosis (CHR-P)  present with a clinical syndrome that can include social withdrawal and have a  20-35% risk of developing psychosis in the next 2 years. Recent research shows that  resting hippocampal blood flow is altered in CHR-P individuals and predicts adverse  clinical outcomes, such as non-remission/transition to frank psychosis. Previous  work in healthy males indicates that a single dose of intranasal oxytocin has  positive effects on social function and marked effects on resting hippocampal blood  flow. The present study examined the effects of intranasal oxytocin on hippocampal  blood flow in CHR-P individuals. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover  design, 30 CHR-P males were studied using pseudo-continuous Arterial Spin Labelling  on 2 occasions, once after 40IU intranasal oxytocin and once after placebo. The  effects of oxytocin on left hippocampal blood flow were examined in a  region-of-interest analysis of data acquired at 22-28 and at 30-36 minutes  post-intranasal administration. Relative to placebo, administration of oxytocin was  associated with increased hippocampal blood flow at both time points (p = .0056;  p = .034), although the effect at the second did not survive adjustment for the  effect of global blood flow. These data indicate that oxytocin can modulate  hippocampal function in CHR-P individuals and therefore merits further investigation  as a candidate novel treatment for this group.},
