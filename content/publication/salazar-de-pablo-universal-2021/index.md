abstract: "BACKGROUND: Much is not known about the efficacy of interventions to prevent\
  \ poor mental health outcomes in young people by targeting either the general population\
  \  (universal prevention) or asymptomatic individuals with high risk of developing\
  \ a  mental disorder (selective prevention). METHODS: We conducted a  PRISMA/MOOSE-compliant\
  \ systematic review and meta-analysis of Web of Science to  identify studies comparing\
  \ post-test efficacy (effect size [ES]; Hedges' g) of  universal or selective interventions\
  \ for poor mental health outcomes versus control  groups, in samples with mean age\
  \ textless35 years (PROSPERO: CRD42018102143). Measurements  included random-effects\
  \ models, I2 statistics, publication bias, meta-regression,  sensitivity analyses,\
  \ quality assessments, number needed to treat, and population  impact number. RESULTS:\
  \ 295 articles (447,206 individuals; mean age = 15.4)  appraising 17 poor mental\
  \ health outcomes were included. Compared to control  conditions, universal and\
  \ selective interventions improved (in descending magnitude  order) interpersonal\
  \ violence, general psychological distress, alcohol use, anxiety  features, affective\
  \ symptoms, other emotional and behavioral problems, consequences  of alcohol use,\
  \ posttraumatic stress disorder features, conduct problems, tobacco  use, externalizing\
  \ behaviors, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder features, and  cannabis use,\
  \ but not eating-related problems, impaired functioning, internalizing  behavior,\
  \ or sleep-related problems. Psychoeducation had the highest effect size for  ADHD\
  \ features, affective symptoms, and interpersonal violence. Psychotherapy had the\
  \  highest effect size for anxiety features. CONCLUSION: Universal and selective\
  \  preventive interventions for young individuals are feasible and can improve poor\
  \  mental health outcomes."
