abstract: 'Cannabidiol (CBD) is being investigated as a treatment for several medical
  disorders but there is uncertainty about its safety. We conducted the first systematic
  review  and meta-analysis of the adverse effects of CBD across all medical indications.  Double-blind
  randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials lasting â‰¥7 days were  included. Twelve
  trials contributed data from 803 participants to the meta-analysis.  Compared with
  placebo, CBD was associated with an increased likelihood of withdrawal  for any
  reason (OR 2.61, 95% CI: 1.38-4.96) or due to adverse events (OR 2.65, 95%  CI:
  1.04-6.80), any serious adverse event (OR 2.30, 95% CI: 1.18-4.48), serious  adverse
  events related to abnormal liver function tests (OR 11.19, 95% CI:  2.09-60.02)
  or pneumonia (OR 5.37, 95% CI: 1.17-24.65), any adverse event (OR 1.55,  95% CI:
  1.03-2.33), adverse events due to decreased appetite (OR 3.56, 95% CI:  1.94-6.53),
  diarrhoea (OR 2.61, 95% CI: 1.46-4.67), somnolence (OR 2.23, 95% CI:  1.07-4.64)
  and sedation (OR 4.21, 95% CI: 1.18-15.01). Associations with abnormal  liver function
  tests, somnolence, sedation and pneumonia were limited to childhood  epilepsy studies,
  where CBD may have interacted with other medications such as  clobazam and/or sodium
  valproate. After excluding studies in childhood epilepsy, the  only adverse outcome
  associated with CBD treatment was diarrhoea (OR 5.03, 95% CI:  1.44-17.61). In summary,
  the available data from clinical trials suggest that CBD is  well tolerated and
  has relatively few serious adverse effects, however interactions  with other medications
  should be monitored carefully. Additional safety data from  clinical trials outside
  of childhood epilepsy syndromes and from studies of  over-the-counter CBD products
  are needed to assess whether the conclusions drawn  from clinical trials can be
  applied more broadly.'
