 abstract = {Twenty percent of individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR-P) develop the disorder within 2 years. Extensive research has explored the factors that  differentiate those who develop psychosis and those who do not, but the results are  conflicting. The current systematic review and meta-analysis comprehensively  addresses the consistency and magnitude of evidence for non-purely genetic risk and  protective factors associated with the risk of developing psychosis in CHR-P  individuals. Random effects meta-analyses, standardized mean difference (SMD) and  odds ratio (OR) were used, in combination with an established stratification of  evidence that assesses the association of each factor and the onset of psychotic  disorders (from class I, convincing evidence to class IV weak evidence), while  controlling for several types of biases. A total of 128 original controlled studies  relating to 26 factors were retrieved. No factors showed class I-convincing  evidence. Two further factors were associated with class II-highly suggestive  evidence: attenuated positive psychotic symptoms (SMD = 0.348, 95% CI: 0.280, 0.415)  and global functioning (SMD = -0.291, 95% CI: -0.370, -0.211). There was class  III-suggestive evidence for negative psychotic symptoms (SMD = 0.393, 95% CI: 0.317,  0.469). There was either class IV-weak or no evidence for all other factors. Our  findings suggest that despite the large number of putative risk factors investigated  in the literature, only attenuated positive psychotic symptoms, global functioning,  and negative psychotic symptoms show suggestive evidence or greater for association  with transition to psychosis. The current findings may inform the refinement of  clinical prediction models and precision medicine in this field.},
