	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, coronaviruses caused two noteworthy outbreaks: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), starting in 2002, and Middle  East respiratory syndrome (MERS), starting in 2012. We aimed to assess the  psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. METHODS:  In this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the  Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases (from their  inception until March 18, 2020), and medRxiv, bioRxiv, and PsyArXiv (between Jan 1,  2020, and April 10, 2020) were searched by two independent researchers for all  English-language studies or preprints reporting data on the psychiatric and  neuropsychiatric presentations of individuals with suspected or laboratory-confirmed  coronavirus infection (SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, or SARS coronavirus 2).  We excluded studies limited to neurological complications without specified  neuropsychiatric presentations and those investigating the indirect effects of  coronavirus infections on the mental health of people who are not infected, such as  those mediated through physical distancing measures such as self-isolation or  quarantine. Outcomes were psychiatric signs or symptoms; symptom severity; diagnoses  based on ICD-10, DSM-IV, or the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (third  edition) or psychometric scales; quality of life; and employment. Both the  systematic review and the meta-analysis stratified outcomes across illness stages  (acute vs post-illness) for SARS and MERS. We used a random-effects model for the  meta-analysis, and the meta-analytical effect size was prevalence for relevant  outcomes, I(2) statistics, and assessment of study quality. FINDINGS: 1963 studies  and 87 preprints were identified by the systematic search, of which 65 peer-reviewed  studies and seven preprints met inclusion criteria. The number of coronavirus cases  of the included studies was 3559, ranging from 1 to 997, and the mean age of  participants in studies ranged from 12·2 years (SD 4·1) to 68·0 years (single case  report). Studies were from China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Canada, Saudi Arabia,  France, Japan, Singapore, the UK, and the USA. Follow-up time for the post-illness  studies varied between 60 days and 12 years. The systematic review revealed that  during the acute illness, common symptoms among patients admitted to hospital for  SARS or MERS included confusion (36 [27·9\%; 95\% CI 20·5-36·0] of 129 patients),  depressed mood (42 [32·6\%; 24·7-40·9] of 129), anxiety (46 [35·7\%; 27·6-44·2] of  129), impaired memory (44 [34·1\%; 26·2-42·5] of 129), and insomnia (54 [41·9\%;  22·5-50·5] of 129). Steroid-induced mania and psychosis were reported in 13 (0·7\%)  of 1744 patients with SARS in the acute stage in one study. In the post-illness  stage, depressed mood (35 [10·5\%; 95\% CI 7·5-14·1] of 332 patients), insomnia (34  [12·1\%; 8·6-16·3] of 280), anxiety (21 [12·3\%; 7·7-17·7] of 171), irritability (28  [12·8\%; 8·7-17·6] of 218), memory impairment (44 [18·9\%; 14·1-24·2] of 233), fatigue  (61 [19·3\%; 15·1-23·9] of 316), and in one study traumatic memories (55 [30·4\%;  23·9-37·3] of 181) and sleep disorder (14 [100·0\%; 88·0-100·0] of 14) were  frequently reported. The meta-analysis indicated that in the post-illness stage the  point prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder was 32·2\% (95\% CI 23·7-42·0; 121  of 402 cases from four studies), that of depression was 14·9\% (12·1-18·2; 77 of 517  cases from five studies), and that of anxiety disorders was 14·8\% (11·1-19·4; 42 of  284 cases from three studies). 446 (76·9\%; 95\% CI 68·1-84·6) of 580 patients from  six studies had returned to work at a mean follow-up time of 35·3 months (SD 40·1).  When data for patients with COVID-19 were examined (including preprint data), there  was evidence for delirium (confusion in 26 [65\%] of 40 intensive care unit patients  and agitation in 40 [69\%] of 58 intensive care unit patients in one study, and  altered consciousness in 17 [21\%] of 82 patients who subsequently died in another  study). At discharge, 15 (33\%) of 45 patients with COVID-19 who were assessed had a  dysexecutive syndrome in one study. At the time of writing, there were two reports  of hypoxic encephalopathy and one report of encephalitis. 68 (94\%) of the 72 studies  were of either low or medium quality. INTERPRETATION: If infection with SARS-CoV-2  follows a similar course to that with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, most patients should  recover without experiencing mental illness. SARS-CoV-2 might cause delirium in a  significant proportion of patients in the acute stage. Clinicians should be aware of  the possibility of depression, anxiety, fatigue, post-traumatic stress disorder, and  rarer neuropsychiatric syndromes in the longer term.

	abstract = {Psychosis is a heterogeneous psychiatric condition for which a multitude of risk and protective factors have been suggested. This umbrella review aimed to classify the  strength of evidence for the associations between each factor and psychotic  disorders whilst controlling for several biases. The Web of Knowledge database was  searched to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies  which examined associations between socio-demographic, parental, perinatal, later  factors or antecedents and psychotic disorders, and which included a comparison  group of healthy controls, published from 1965 to January 31, 2017. The literature  search and data extraction followed PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. The association  between each factor and ICD or DSM diagnoses of non-organic psychotic disorders was  graded into convincing, highly suggestive, suggestive, weak, or non-significant  according to a standardized classification based on: number of psychotic cases,  random-effects p value, largest study 95\% confidence interval, heterogeneity between  studies, 95\% prediction interval, small study effect, and excess significance bias.  In order to assess evidence for temporality of association, we also conducted  sensitivity analyses restricted to data from prospective studies. Fifty-five  meta-analyses or systematic reviews were included in the umbrella review,  corresponding to 683 individual studies and 170 putative risk or protective factors  for psychotic disorders. Only the ultra-high-risk state for psychosis (odds ratio,  OR=9.32, 95\% CI: 4.91-17.72) and Black-Caribbean ethnicity in England (OR=4.87, 95\%  CI: 3.96-6.00) showed convincing evidence of association. Six factors were highly  suggestive (ethnic minority in low ethnic density area, second generation  immigrants, trait anhedonia, premorbid IQ, minor physical anomalies, and olfactory  identification ability), and nine were suggestive (urbanicity, ethnic minority in  high ethnic density area, first generation immigrants, North-African immigrants in  Europe, winter/spring season of birth in Northern hemisphere, childhood social  withdrawal, childhood trauma, Toxoplasma gondii IgG, and non-right handedness). When  only prospective studies were considered, the evidence was convincing for  ultra-high-risk state and suggestive for urbanicity only. In summary, this umbrella  review found several factors to be associated with psychotic disorders with  different levels of evidence. These risk or protective factors represent a starting  point for further etiopathological research and for the improvement of the  prediction of psychosis.},

	abstract = {Cannabidiol (CBD) is being investigated as a treatment for several medical disorders but there is uncertainty about its safety. We conducted the first systematic review  and meta-analysis of the adverse effects of CBD across all medical indications.  Double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials lasting ≥7 days were  included. Twelve trials contributed data from 803 participants to the meta-analysis.  Compared with placebo, CBD was associated with an increased likelihood of withdrawal  for any reason (OR 2.61, 95\% CI: 1.38-4.96) or due to adverse events (OR 2.65, 95\%  CI: 1.04-6.80), any serious adverse event (OR 2.30, 95\% CI: 1.18-4.48), serious  adverse events related to abnormal liver function tests (OR 11.19, 95\% CI:  2.09-60.02) or pneumonia (OR 5.37, 95\% CI: 1.17-24.65), any adverse event (OR 1.55,  95\% CI: 1.03-2.33), adverse events due to decreased appetite (OR 3.56, 95\% CI:  1.94-6.53), diarrhoea (OR 2.61, 95\% CI: 1.46-4.67), somnolence (OR 2.23, 95\% CI:  1.07-4.64) and sedation (OR 4.21, 95\% CI: 1.18-15.01). Associations with abnormal  liver function tests, somnolence, sedation and pneumonia were limited to childhood  epilepsy studies, where CBD may have interacted with other medications such as  clobazam and/or sodium valproate. After excluding studies in childhood epilepsy, the  only adverse outcome associated with CBD treatment was diarrhoea (OR 5.03, 95\% CI:  1.44-17.61). In summary, the available data from clinical trials suggest that CBD is  well tolerated and has relatively few serious adverse effects, however interactions  with other medications should be monitored carefully. Additional safety data from  clinical trials outside of childhood epilepsy syndromes and from studies of  over-the-counter CBD products are needed to assess whether the conclusions drawn  from clinical trials can be applied more broadly.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prenatal and perinatal insults are implicated in the aetiopathogenesis of psychotic disorders but the consistency and magnitude of their associations with  psychosis have not been updated for nearly two decades. The aim of this systematic  review and meta-analysis was to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of  the evidence on the association between prenatal or perinatal risk and protective  factors and psychotic disorders. METHODS: In this systematic review and  meta-analysis, we searched the Web of Science database for articles published up to  July 20, 2019. We identified cohort and case-control studies examining the  association (odds ratio [OR]) between prenatal and perinatal factors and any  International Classification of Diseases (ICD) or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual  of Mental Disorders (DSM) non-organic psychotic disorder with a healthy comparison  group. Other inclusion criteria were enough data available to do the analyses, and  non-overlapping datasets. We excluded reviews, meta-analyses, abstracts or  conference proceedings, and articles with overlapping datasets. Data were extracted  according to EQUATOR and PRISMA guidelines. Extracted variables included first  author, publication year, study type, sample size, type of psychotic diagnosis  (non-affective psychoses or schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, affective psychoses)  and diagnostic instrument (DSM or ICD and version), the risk or protective factor,  and measure of association (primary outcome). We did random-effects pairwise  meta-analyses, Q statistics, I(2) index, sensitivity analyses, meta-regressions, and  assessed study quality and publication bias. The study protocol was registered at  PROSPERO, CRD42017079261. FINDINGS: 152 studies relating to 98 risk or protective  factors were eligible for analysis. Significant risk factors were: maternal age  younger than 20 years (OR 1·17) and 30-34 years (OR 1·05); paternal age younger than  20 years (OR 1·31) and older than 35 years (OR 1·28); any maternal (OR 4·60) or  paternal (OR 2·73) psychopathology; maternal psychosis (OR 7·61) and affective  disorder (OR 2·26); three or more pregnancies (OR 1·30); herpes simplex 2 (OR 1·35);  maternal infections not otherwise specified (NOS; OR 1·27); suboptimal number of  antenatal visits (OR 1·83); winter (OR 1·05) and winter to spring (OR 1·05) season  of birth in the northern hemisphere; maternal stress NOS (OR 2·40); famine (OR  1·61); any famine or nutritional deficits in pregnancy (OR 1·40); maternal  hypertension (OR 1·40); hypoxia (OR 1·63); ruptured (OR 1·86) and premature rupture  (OR 2·29) of membranes; polyhydramnios (OR 3·05); definite obstetric complications  NOS (OR 1·83); birthweights of less than 2000 g (OR 1·84), less than 2500 g (OR  1·53), or 2500-2999 g (OR 1·23); birth length less than 49 cm (OR 1·17); small for  gestational age (OR 1·40); premature birth (OR 1·35), and congenital malformations  (OR 2·35). Significant protective factors were maternal ages 20-24 years (OR 0·93)  and 25-29 years (OR 0·92), nulliparity (OR 0·91), and birthweights 3500-3999 g (OR  0·90) or more than 4000 g (OR 0·86). The results were corrected for publication  biases; sensitivity and meta-regression analyses confirmed the robustness of these  findings for most factors. INTERPRETATION: Several prenatal and perinatal factors  are associated with the later onset of psychosis. The updated knowledge emerging  from this study could refine understanding of psychosis pathogenesis, enhance  multivariable risk prediction, and inform preventive strategies. FUNDING: None.},

Our aim was to evaluate the consistency and magnitude of the efficacy of universal/selective  interventions to promote good mental health. A systematic PRISMA/RIGHT-compliant  meta-analysis (PROSPERO: CRD42018088708) search of Web of Science until 04/31/2019  identified original studies comparing the efficacy of universal/selective  interventions for good mental health vs a control group, in samples with a mean age  {\textless}35 years. Meta-analytical random-effects model, heterogeneity statistics,  assessment of publication bias, study quality and sensitivity analyses investigated  the efficacy (Hedges' g=effect size, ES) of universal/selective interventions to  promote 14 good mental health outcomes defined a-priori. 276 studies were included  (total participants: 159,508, 79,142 interventions and 80,366 controls), mean  age=15.0 (SD=7.4); female=56.0\%. There was a significant overall improvement in  10/13 good mental health outcome categories that could be meta-analysed: compared to  controls, interventions significantly improved (in descending order of magnitude)  mental health literacy (ES=0.685, p{\textless}0.001), emotions (ES=0.541, p{\textless}0.001),  self-perceptions and values (ES=0.49, p{\textless}0.001), quality of life (ES=0.457, p=0.001),  cognitive skills (ES=0.428, p{\textless}0.001), social skills (ES=0.371, p{\textless}0.001), physical  health (ES=0.285, p{\textless}0.001), sexual health (ES=0.257, p=0.017), academic/occupational  performance (ES=0.211, p{\textless}0.001) and attitude towards mental disorders (ES=0.177,  p=0.006). Psychoeducation was the most effective intervention for promoting mental  health literacy (ES=0.774, p{\textless}0.001) and cognitive skills (ES=1.153, p=0.03).  Physical therapy, exercise and relaxation were more effective than psychoeducation  and psychotherapy for promoting physical health (ES=0.498, p{\textless}0.001). In conclusion,  several universal/selective interventions can be effective to promote good mental  health in young people. Future research should consolidate and extend these  findings.},

	abstract = {Conversation between two people involves subtle nonverbal coordination in addition to speech. However, the precise parameters and timing of this coordination remain  unclear, which limits our ability to theorize about the neural and cognitive  mechanisms of social coordination. In particular, it is unclear if conversation is  dominated by synchronization (with no time lag), rapid and reactive mimicry (with  lags under 1 s) or traditionally observed mimicry (with several seconds lag), each  of which demands a different neural mechanism. Here we describe data from  high-resolution motion capture of the head movements of pairs of participants  (n = 31 dyads) engaged in structured conversations. In a pre-registered analysis  pathway, we calculated the wavelet coherence of head motion within dyads as a  measure of their nonverbal coordination and report two novel results. First,  low-frequency coherence (0.2-1.1 Hz) is consistent with traditional observations of  mimicry, and modeling shows this behavior is generated by a mechanism with a  constant 600 ms lag between leader and follower. This is in line with rapid reactive  (rather than predictive or memory-driven) models of mimicry behavior, and could be  implemented in mirror neuron systems. Second, we find an unexpected pattern of  lower-than-chance coherence between participants, or hypo-coherence, at high  frequencies (2.6-6.5 Hz). Exploratory analyses show that this systematic decoupling  is driven by fast nodding from the listening member of the dyad, and may be a newly  identified social signal. These results provide a step towards the quantification of  real-world human behavior in high resolution and provide new insights into the  mechanisms of social coordination.},

	abstract = {Primary prevention in individuals at Clinical High Risk for psychosis (CHR-P) can ameliorate the course of psychotic disorders. Further advancements of knowledge have  been slowed by the standstill of the field, which is mostly attributed to its  epidemiological weakness. The latter, in turn, underlies the limited identification  power of at-risk individuals and the relatively modest ability of CHR-P interviews  to rule-in a state of risk for psychosis. In the first part, this perspective review  discusses these limitations and traces a new approach to overcome them. Theoretical  concepts to support a Psychosis Polyrisk Score (PPS) integrating genetic and  non-genetic risk and protective factors for psychosis are presented. The PPS hinges  on recent findings indicating that risk enrichment in CHR-P samples is accounted for  by the accumulation of non-genetic factors such as: parental and sociodemographic  risk factors, perinatal risk factors, later risk factors, and antecedents. In the  second part of this perspective review we present a prototype of a PPS encompassing  core predictors beyond genetics. The PPS prototype may be piloted in the next  generation of CHR-P research and combined with genetic information to refine the  detection of individuals at-risk of psychosis and the prediction of their outcomes,  and ultimately advance clinical research in this field.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The neural correlates of the cognitive dysfunction in first-episode psychosis (FEP) are still unclear. The present review and meta-analysis provide an  update of the location of the abnormalities in the fMRI-measured brain response to  cognitive processes in individuals with FEP. METHODS: Systematic review and  voxel-based meta-analysis of cross-sectional fMRI studies comparing neural responses  to cognitive tasks between individuals with FEP and healthy controls (HC) according  to PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies were included, comprising 598  individuals with FEP and 567 HC. Individual studies reported statistically  significant hypoactivation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (6 studies),  frontal lobe (8 studies), cingulate (6 studies) and insula (5 studies). The  meta-analysis showed statistically significant hypoactivation in the left anterior  insula, precuneus and bilateral striatum. CONCLUSIONS: While the studies tend to  highlight frontal hypoactivation during cognitive tasks in FEP, our meta-analytic  results show that the left precuneus and insula primarily display aberrant  activation in FEP that may be associated with salience attribution to external  stimuli and related to deficits in perception and regulation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Psychosis Polyrisk Score (PPS) is a potential biomarker integrating non-purely genetic risk/protective factors for psychosis that may improve  identification of individuals at risk and prediction of their outcomes at the  individual subject level. Biomarkers that are easy to administer are direly needed  in early psychosis to facilitate clinical implementation. This study digitally  implements the PPS and pilots its feasibility of use in the real world. METHODS: The  PPS was implemented digitally and prospectively piloted across individuals referred  for a CHR-P assessment (n = 16) and healthy controls (n = 66). Distribution of PPS  scores was further simulated in the general population. RESULTS: 98.8\% of  individuals referred for a CHR-P assessment and healthy controls completed the PPS  assessment with only one drop-out. 96.3\% of participants completed the assessment in  under 15 min. Individuals referred for a CHR-P assessment had high PPS scores  (mean = 6.2, SD = 7.23) than healthy controls (mean = -1.79, SD = 6.78, p {\textless} 0.001).  In simulated general population data, scores were normally distributed ranging from  -15 (lowest risk, RR = 0.03) to 39.5 (highest risk, RR = 8912.51). DISCUSSION: The  PPS is a promising biomarker which has been implemented digitally. The PPS can be  easily administered to both healthy controls and individuals at potential risk for  psychosis on a range of devices. It is feasible to use the PPS in real world  settings to assess individuals with emerging mental disorders. The next phase of  research should be to include the PPS in large-scale international cohort studies to  evaluate its ability to refine the prognostication of outcomes.},

Oxytocin, a neuropeptide with prosocial and  anxiolytic properties, modulates glutamate neurotransmission in preclinical models  but its neurochemical effects in people at high risk for psychosis are unknown. We  used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) to examine the effects of  intranasal oxytocin on glutamate and other metabolites in people at Clinical High  Risk for Psychosis (CHR-P) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design.  30 CHR-P males were studied on two occasions, once after 40IU intranasal oxytocin  and once after placebo. The effects of oxytocin on the concentration of glutamate,  glutamate+glutamine and other metabolites (choline, N-acetylaspartate, myo-inositol)  scaled to creatine were examined in the left thalamus, anterior cingulate cortex  (ACC) and left hippocampus, starting approximately 75, 84 and 93 min post-dosing,  respectively. Relative to placebo, administration of oxytocin was associated with an  increase in choline levels in the ACC (p=.008, Cohen's d = 0.54). There were no  other significant effects on metabolite concentrations (all p{\textgreater}.05). Our findings  suggest that, at ∼75-99 min post-dosing, a single dose of intranasal oxytocin does  not alter levels of neurochemical metabolites in the thalamus, ACC, or hippocampus  in those at CHR-P, aside from potential effects on choline in the ACC.},

People at Clinical High Risk for psychosis (CHR-P)  present with a clinical syndrome that can include social withdrawal and have a  20-35\% risk of developing psychosis in the next 2 years. Recent research shows that  resting hippocampal blood flow is altered in CHR-P individuals and predicts adverse  clinical outcomes, such as non-remission/transition to frank psychosis. Previous  work in healthy males indicates that a single dose of intranasal oxytocin has  positive effects on social function and marked effects on resting hippocampal blood  flow. The present study examined the effects of intranasal oxytocin on hippocampal  blood flow in CHR-P individuals. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover  design, 30 CHR-P males were studied using pseudo-continuous Arterial Spin Labelling  on 2 occasions, once after 40IU intranasal oxytocin and once after placebo. The  effects of oxytocin on left hippocampal blood flow were examined in a  region-of-interest analysis of data acquired at 22-28 and at 30-36 minutes  post-intranasal administration. Relative to placebo, administration of oxytocin was  associated with increased hippocampal blood flow at both time points (p = .0056;  p = .034), although the effect at the second did not survive adjustment for the  effect of global blood flow. These data indicate that oxytocin can modulate  hippocampal function in CHR-P individuals and therefore merits further investigation  as a candidate novel treatment for this group.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Formal thought disorder is a cardinal feature of psychotic disorders, and is also evident in subtle forms before psychosis onset in individuals at  clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR-P). Assessing speech output or assessing  expressive language with speech as the medium at this stage may be particularly  useful in predicting later transition to psychosis. METHOD: Speech samples were  acquired through administration of the Thought and Language Index (TLI) in 24 CHR-P  participants, 16 people with first-episode psychosis (FEP) and 13 healthy controls.  The CHR-P individuals were then followed clinically for a mean of 7 years  (s.d. = 1.5) to determine if they transitioned to psychosis. Non-semantic speech  graph analysis was used to assess the connectedness of transcribed speech in all  groups. RESULTS: Speech was significantly more disconnected in the FEP group than in  both healthy controls (p {\textless} .01) and the CHR-P group (p {\textless} .05). Results remained  significant when IQ was included as a covariate. Significant correlations were found  between speech connectedness measures and scores on the TLI, a manual assessment of  formal thought disorder. In the CHR-P group, lower scores on two measures of speech  connectedness were associated with subsequent transition to psychosis (8  transitions, 16 non-transitions; p {\textless} .05). CONCLUSION: These findings support the  utility and validity of speech graph analysis methods in characterizing speech  connectedness in the early phases of psychosis. This approach has the potential to  be developed into an automated, objective and time-efficient way of stratifying  individuals at CHR-P according to level of psychosis risk.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Improving outcomes of a First Episode of Psychosis (FEP) relies on the ability to detect most individuals with emerging psychosis and treat them in  specialised Early Intervention (EI) services. Efficacy of current detection  strategies is undetermined. METHODS: RECORD-compliant clinical, 6-year,  retrospective, transdiagnostic, lifespan-inclusive, Electronic Health Record (EHR)  cohort study, representing real-world secondary mental healthcare in South London  and Maudsley (SLaM) NHS. All individuals accessing SLaM in the period 2007-2017 and  receiving any ICD-10 diagnosis other than persistent psychosis were included.  Descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier curves, logistic regression, epidemiological  incidence of psychosis in the general population were used to address pathways to  care and detection power of EI services for FEP. RESULTS: A total of 106,706  individuals underwent the 6-year follow-up: they were mostly single (72.57\%) males  (50.51\%) of white ethnicity (60.01\%), aged on average 32.96 years, with an average  Health Of the Nation Outcome Scale score of 11.12 and mostly affected with F40-48  Neurotic/stress-related/somatoform disorders (27.46\%). Their transdiagnostic risk of  developing a FEP cumulated to 0.072 (95\%CI 0.067-0.077) at 6 years. Those  individuals who developed a FEP (n = 1841) entered healthcare mostly (79.02\%)  through inpatient mental health services (29.76\%), community mental health services  (29.54\%) or accident and emergency departments (19.50\%); at the time of FEP onset,  most of them (46.43\%) were under the acute care pathway. Individuals contacting  accident and emergency departments had an increased risk of FEP (OR 2.301, 95\%CI  2.095-2.534, P {\textless} 0.001). The proportion of SLaM FEP cases that were eligible and  under the care of EI services was 0.456 at any time. The epidemiological proportion  of FEP cases in the sociodemographically-matched general population that was  detected by EI service was 0.373. CONCLUSIONS: More than half of individuals who  develop a FEP remain undetected by current pathways to care and EI services.  Improving detection strategies should become a mainstream area in the future  generation of early psychosis research.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that an automated, lifespan-inclusive, transdiagnostic, and clinically based, individualized risk calculator provides a powerful system for  supporting the early detection of individuals at-risk of psychosis at a large scale,  by leveraging electronic health records (EHRs). This risk calculator has been  externally validated twice and is undergoing feasibility testing for clinical  implementation. Integration of this risk calculator in clinical routine should be  facilitated by prospective feasibility studies, which are required to address  pragmatic challenges, such as missing data, and the usability of this risk  calculator in a real-world and routine clinical setting. Here, we present an  approach for a prospective implementation of a real-time psychosis risk detection  and alerting service in a real-world EHR system. This method leverages the CogStack  platform, which is an open-source, lightweight, and distributed information  retrieval and text extraction system. The CogStack platform incorporates a set of  services that allow for full-text search of clinical data, lifespan-inclusive,  real-time calculation of psychosis risk, early risk-alerting to clinicians, and the  visual monitoring of patients over time. Our method includes: 1) ingestion and  synchronization of data from multiple sources into the CogStack platform, 2)  implementation of a risk calculator, whose algorithm was previously developed and  validated, for timely computation of a patient's risk of psychosis, 3) creation of  interactive visualizations and dashboards to monitor patients' health status over  time, and 4) building automated alerting systems to ensure that clinicians are  notified of patients at-risk, so that appropriate actions can be pursued. This is  the first ever study that has developed and implemented a similar detection and  alerting system in clinical routine for early detection of psychosis.},

	abstract = {Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction (i.e., increased sympathetic and/or decreased parasympathetic activity) has been proposed to contribute to psychosis  vulnerability. Yet, we still lack directed therapeutic strategies that improve ANS  regulation in psychosis or at-risk states. The oxytocin system constitutes a  potential therapeutic target, given its role in ANS regulation. However, whether  intranasal oxytocin ameliorates autonomic regulation during emerging psychosis is  currently unknown. We pooled together two datasets, one of 30 men at clinical high  risk for psychosis (CHR-P), and another of 17 healthy men, who had participated in  two double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomised, crossover MRI studies with  similar protocols. All participants self-administered 40 IU of intranasal oxytocin  or placebo using a nasal spray. We recorded pulse plethysmography during a period of  8 min at about 1 h post dosing and estimated heart rate (HR) and high-frequency HR  variability (HF-HRV), an index of cardio-parasympathetic activity. CHR-P and healthy  men did not differ at resting HR or HF-HRV under placebo. We found a significant  condition × treatment effect for HF-HRV, showing that intranasal oxytocin, compared  with placebo, increased HF-HRV in CHR-P but not in healthy men. The main effects of  treatment and condition were not significant. In this proof-of-concept study, we  show that intranasal oxytocin increases cardio-parasympathetic activity in CHR-P  men, highlighting its therapeutic potential to improve autonomic regulation in this  clinical group. Our findings support the need for further research on the preventive  and therapeutic potential of intranasal oxytocin during emerging psychosis, where we  lack effective treatments.},

This study aimed to investigate the  real-world feasibility of implementing an individualised, transdiagnostic risk  calculator to automatically screen EHRs and detect individuals at-risk for  psychosis. METHODS: Feasibility implementation study encompassing an in-vitro phase  (March 2018 to May 2018) and in-vivo phase (May 2018 to April 2019). The in-vitro  phase addressed implementation barriers and embedded the risk calculator  (predictors: age, gender, ethnicity, index cluster diagnosis, age*gender) into the  local EHR. The in-vivo phase investigated the real-world feasibility of screening  individuals accessing secondary mental healthcare at the South London and Maudsley  NHS Trust. The primary outcome was adherence of clinicians to automatic EHR  screening, defined by the proportion of clinicians who responded to alerts from the  risk calculator, over those contacted. RESULTS: In-vitro phase: implementation  barriers were identified/overcome with clinician and service user engagement, and  the calculator was successfully integrated into the local EHR through the CogStack  platform. In-vivo phase: 3722 individuals were automatically screened and 115 were  detected. Clinician adherence was 74\% without outreach and 85\% with outreach.  One-third of clinicians responded to the first email (37.1\%) or phone calls (33.7\%).  Among those detected, cumulative risk of developing psychosis was 12\% at six-month  follow-up. CONCLUSION: This is the first implementation study suggesting that  combining precision psychiatry and EHR methods to improve detection of individuals  with emerging psychosis is feasible. Future psychiatric implementation research is  urgently needed.},

Extensive research has explored the factors that  differentiate those who develop psychosis and those who do not, but the results are  conflicting. The current systematic review and meta-analysis comprehensively  addresses the consistency and magnitude of evidence for non-purely genetic risk and  protective factors associated with the risk of developing psychosis in CHR-P  individuals. Random effects meta-analyses, standardized mean difference (SMD) and  odds ratio (OR) were used, in combination with an established stratification of  evidence that assesses the association of each factor and the onset of psychotic  disorders (from class I, convincing evidence to class IV weak evidence), while  controlling for several types of biases. A total of 128 original controlled studies  relating to 26 factors were retrieved. No factors showed class I-convincing  evidence. Two further factors were associated with class II-highly suggestive  evidence: attenuated positive psychotic symptoms (SMD = 0.348, 95\% CI: 0.280, 0.415)  and global functioning (SMD = -0.291, 95\% CI: -0.370, -0.211). There was class  III-suggestive evidence for negative psychotic symptoms (SMD = 0.393, 95\% CI: 0.317,  0.469). There was either class IV-weak or no evidence for all other factors. Our  findings suggest that despite the large number of putative risk factors investigated  in the literature, only attenuated positive psychotic symptoms, global functioning,  and negative psychotic symptoms show suggestive evidence or greater for association  with transition to psychosis.

However, current  treatments do not significantly ameliorate social impairments in CHR-P individuals.  Given its critical role in social behaviour and cognition, the oxytocinergic (OT)  system is a promising target for novel interventions in CHR-P subjects. In a  double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, 30 CHR-P males were studied  using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on two occasions, once after 40IU  self-administered intranasal OT and once after placebo. A modified version of the  Sally-Anne task was used to assess brain activation during inferring others' beliefs  and social emotions. The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test was acquired prior to the  first scan to test whether OT effects were moderated by baseline social-emotional  abilities. OT did not modulate behavioural performances but reduced activation in  the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus compared with placebo while inferring others'  social emotions. Furthermore, the relationship between brain activation and task  performance after OT administration was moderated by baseline social-emotional  abilities. While task accuracy during inferring others' social emotion increased  with decreasing activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus in CHR-P individuals  with low social-emotional abilities, there was no such relationship in CHR-P  individuals with high social-emotional abilities. Our findings may suggest that  acute OT administration enhances neural efficiency in the inferior frontal gyrus  during inferring others' social emotions in those CHR-P subjects with low baseline  social-emotional abilities.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical research into the Clinical High Risk state for Psychosis (CHR-P) has allowed primary indicated prevention in psychiatry to improve outcomes  of psychotic disorders. The strategic component of this approach is the  implementation of clinical services to detect and take care of CHR-P individuals,  which are recommended by several guidelines. The actual level of implementation of  CHR-P services worldwide is not completely clear. AIM: To assess the global  geographical distribution, core characteristics relating to the level of  implementation of CHR-P services; to overview of the main barriers that limit their  implementation at scale. METHODS: CHR-P services worldwide were invited to complete  an online survey. The survey addressed the geographical distribution, general  implementation characteristics and implementation barriers. RESULTS: The survey was  completed by 47 CHR-P services offering care to 22 248 CHR-P individuals: Western  Europe (51.1\%), North America (17.0\%), East Asia (17.0\%), Australia (6.4\%), South  America (6.4\%) and Africa (2.1\%). Their implementation characteristics included  heterogeneous clinical settings, assessment instruments and length of care offered.  Most CHR-P patients were recruited through mental or physical health services.  Preventive interventions included clinical monitoring and crisis management (80.1\%),  supportive therapy (70.2\%) or structured psychotherapy (61.7\%), in combination with  pharmacological treatment (in 74.5\%). Core implementation barriers were staffing and  financial constraints, and the recruitment of CHR-P individuals. The dynamic map of  CHR-P services has been implemented on the IEPA website:  https://iepa.org.au/list-a-service/. CONCLUSIONS: Worldwide primary indicated  prevention of psychosis in CHR-P individuals is possible, but the implementation of  CHR-P services is heterogeneous and constrained by pragmatic challenges.},

	abstract = {The real-world impact of psychosis prevention is reliant on effective strategies for identifying individuals at risk. A transdiagnostic, individualized, clinically-based  risk calculator to improve this has been developed and externally validated twice in  two different UK healthcare trusts with convincing results. The prognostic  performance of this risk calculator outside the UK is unknown. All individuals who  accessed primary or secondary health care services belonging to the IBM(®)  MarketScan(®) Commercial Database between January 2015 and December 2017, and  received a first ICD-10 index diagnosis of nonorganic/nonpsychotic mental disorder,  were included. According to the risk calculator, age, gender, ethnicity,  age-by-gender, and ICD-10 cluster diagnosis at index date were used to predict  development of any ICD-10 nonorganic psychotic disorder. Because patient-level  ethnicity data were not available city-level ethnicity proportions were used as  proxy. The study included 2,430,333 patients with a mean follow-up of 15.36 months  and cumulative incidence of psychosis at two years of 1.43\%. There were profound  differences compared to the original development UK database in terms of case-mix,  psychosis incidence, distribution of baseline predictors (ICD-10 cluster diagnoses),  availability of patient-level ethnicity data, follow-up time and availability of  specialized clinical services for at-risk individuals. Despite these important  differences, the model retained accuracy significantly above chance (Harrell's  C = 0.676, 95\% CI: 0.672-0.679). To date, this is the largest international external  replication of an individualized prognostic model in the field of psychiatry. This  risk calculator is transportable on an international scale to improve the automatic  detection of individuals at risk of psychosis.},

To overcome this problem, a transdiagnostic, clinically based,  individualized risk calculator has recently been developed and subjected to a first  external validation in 2 different catchment areas of the South London and Maudsley  (SLaM) NHS Trust. METHODS: Second external validation of real world, real-time  electronic clinical register-based cohort study. All individuals who received a  first ICD-10 index diagnosis of nonorganic and nonpsychotic mental disorder within  the Camden and Islington (C\&I) NHS Trust between 2009 and 2016 were included. The  model previously validated included age, gender, ethnicity, age by gender, and  ICD-10 index diagnosis to predict the development of any ICD-10 nonorganic  psychosis. The model's performance was measured using Harrell's C-index. RESULTS:  This study included a total of 13702 patients with an average age of 40 (range  16-99), 52\% were female, and most were of white ethnicity (64\%). There were no CHR-P  or child/adolescent services in the C\&I Trust. The C\&I and SLaM Trust samples also  differed significantly in terms of age, gender, ethnicity, and distribution of index  diagnosis. Despite these significant differences, the original model retained an  acceptable predictive performance (Harrell's C of 0.73), which is comparable to that  of CHR-P tools currently recommended for clinical use. CONCLUSIONS: This risk  calculator may pragmatically support an improved transdiagnostic detection of  at-risk individuals and psychosis prediction even in NHS Trusts in the United  Kingdom where CHR-P services are not provided.},

Their pathways to care, treatment offered and long-term clinical outcomes beyond  risk to psychosis are unexplored. We conducted an electronic health record-based  retrospective cohort study including patients with ATPDs within the SLaM NHS Trust  and followed-up to 8 years. METHODS: A total of 2561 ATPDs were included in the  study. A minority were detected (8\%) and treated (18\%) by Early Intervention  services (EIS) and none by CHR-P services. Patients were offered a clinical  follow-up of 350.40 ± 589.90 days. The cumulative incidence of discharges was 40\% at  3 months, 60\% at 1 year, 69\% at 2 years, 77\% at 4 years, and 82\% at 8 years.  Treatment was heterogeneous: the majority of patients received antipsychotics (up to  52\%), only a tiny minority psychotherapy (up to 8\%). RESULTS: Over follow-up, 32.88\%  and 28.54\% of ATPDS received at least one mental health hospitalization or one  compulsory hospital admission under the Mental Health Act, respectively. The mean  number of days spent in psychiatric hospital was 66.39 ± 239.44 days. CONCLUSIONS:  The majority of ATPDs are not detected/treated by EIS or CHR-P services, receive  heterogeneous treatments and short-term clinical follow-up. ATPDs have a high risk  of developing severe clinical outcomes beyond persistent psychotic disorders and  unmet clinical needs that are not targeted by current mental health services.},

	abstract = {Background: Primary indicated prevention in individuals at-risk for psychosis has the potential to improve the outcomes of this disorder. The ability to detect the  majority of at-risk individuals is the main barrier toward extending benefits for  the lives of many adolescents and young adults. Current detection strategies are  highly inefficient. Only 5\% (standalone specialized early detection services) to 12\%  (youth mental health services) of individuals who will develop a first psychotic  disorder can be detected at the time of their at-risk stage. To overcome these  challenges a pragmatic, clinically-based, individualized, transdiagnostic risk  calculator has been developed to detect individuals at-risk of psychosis in  secondary mental health care at scale. This calculator has been externally validated  and has demonstrated good prognostic performance. However, it is not known whether  it can be used in the real world clinical routine. For example, clinicians may not  be willing to adhere to the recommendations made by the transdiagnostic risk  calculator. Implementation studies are needed to address pragmatic challenges  relating to the real world use of the transdiagnostic risk calculator. The aim of  the current study is to provide in-vitro and in-vivo feasibility data to support the  implementation of the transdiagnostic risk calculator in clinical routine. Method:  This is a study which comprises of two subsequent phases: an in-vitro phase of 1  month and an in-vivo phase of 11 months. The in-vitro phase aims at developing and  integrating the transdiagnostic risk calculator in the local electronic health  register (primary outcome). The in-vivo phase aims at addressing the clinicians'  adherence to the recommendations made by the transdiagnostic risk calculator  (primary outcome) and other secondary feasibility parameters that are necessary to  estimate the resources needed for its implementation. Discussion: This is the first  implementation study for risk prediction models in individuals at-risk for  psychosis. Ultimately, successful implementation is the true measure of a prediction  model's utility. Therefore, the overall translational deliverable of the current  study would be to extend the benefits of primary indicated prevention and improve  outcomes of first episode psychosis. This may produce significant social benefits  for many adolescents and young adults and their families.},

The long-term course and outcomes of ATPD are not  completely clear. METHODS: Electronic health record-based retrospective cohort  study, including all patients who received a first index diagnosis of ATPD (F23,  ICD-10) within the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) National Health Service Trust,  between 1 st April 2006 and 15th June 2017. The primary outcome was risk of  developing persistent psychotic disorders, defined as the development of any ICD-10  diagnoses of non-organic psychotic disorders. Cumulative risk of psychosis onset was  estimated through Kaplan-Meier failure functions (non-competing risks) and Greenwood  confidence intervals. RESULTS: A total of 3074 patients receiving a first index  diagnosis of ATPD (F23, ICD-10) within SLaM were included. The mean follow-up was  1495 days. After 8-year, 1883 cases (61.26\%) retained the index diagnosis of ATPD;  the remaining developed psychosis. The cumulative incidence (Kaplan-Meier failure  function) of risk of developing any ICD-10 non-organic psychotic disorder was 16.10\%  at 1-year (95\%CI 14.83-17.47\%), 28.41\% at 2-year (95\%CI 26.80-30.09\%), 33.96\% at  3-year (95\% CI 32.25-35.75\%), 36.85\% at 4-year (95\%CI 35.07-38.69\%), 40.99\% at  5-year (95\% CI 39.12-42.92\%), 42.58\% at 6-year (95\%CI 40.67-44.55\%), 44.65\% at  7-year (95\% CI 42.66-46.69\%), and 46.25\% at 8-year (95\% CI 44.17-48.37\%). The  cumulative risk of schizophrenia-spectrum disorder at 8-year was 36.14\% (95\% CI  34.09-38.27\%).

Behavioral studies show that people sometimes imitate irrational  actions, a phenomenon called overimitation. However, limitations on movement in  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) mean that the neural basis of  overimitation has not been studied. To address this, our study employed a less  restrictive neuroimaging technique, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).  Measurements were taken while participants observed either rational or irrational  movements before performing movements on a computerized puzzle task. Observing  irrational actions produced greater activation in right anterior inferior parietal  lobule (aIPL), replicating results from the fMRI literature. This is a proof of  principle that fNIRS can be used as an alternative to fMRI in social cognition  experiments, and that parietal cortex has a core role in responding to irrational  actions.},

Although  several controlled interventional studies have been conducted with the aim of  reducing DUP, the results are highly inconsistent and conflicting. The current study  systematically searches Web of Science and Ovid for English original articles  investigating interventions adopted to reduce DUP, compared to a control  intervention, up to April 6, 2017. Sixteen controlled interventional studies were  retrieved, including 1964 patients in the intervention arm and 1358 in the control  arm. The controlled intervention studies were characterized by standalone first  episode psychosis services, standalone clinical high risk services, community  interventions, healthcare professional training, and multifocus interventions.  Random effects meta-analyses were conducted. There was no summary evidence that  available interventions are successful in reducing DUP during the first episode of  psychosis (Hedges' g = -0.12, 95\% CI = -0.25 to 0.01). Subgroup analyses showed no  differences within each subgroup, with the exception of clinical high risk services  (Hedges' g = -0.386, 95\% CI = -0.726 to -0.045). These negative findings may reflect  a parceled research base in the area, lack of prospective randomized controlled  trials (only 2 randomized cluster designed studies were present) and small sample  sizes. There was substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 66.4\%), most of which was accounted  by different definitions of DUP onset (R2 = .88). Psychometric standardization of  DUP definition, improvement of study design, and implementation of preventative  strategies seem the most promising avenues for reducing DUP and improving outcomes  of first-episode psychosis.},

METHODS:  Prospective cohort study including all consecutive help-seeking individuals  undergoing both a DSM-5-APS and a Comprehensive Assessment of At Risk Mental States  (CAARMS 12/2006) assessment for psychosis risk at the Outreach and Support in South  London (OASIS) UHR service (March 2013-April 2014). The diagnostic significance of  DSM-5-APS was assessed with percent overall agreement, prevalence bias adjusted  kappa, Bowker's test, Stuart-Maxwell test, residual analysis; the prognostic  significance with Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier failure function, time-dependent area  under the curve (AUC) and net benefits analysis. The impact of specific revisions of  the DSM-5-APS was further tested. RESULT: In 203 help-seeking individuals undergoing  UHR assessment, the agreement between the DSM-5-APS and the CAARMS 12/2006 was only  moderate (kappa 0.59). Among 142 nonpsychotic cases, those meeting DSM-5-APS  criteria had a 5-fold probability (HR = 5.379) of developing psychosis compared to  those not meeting DSM-5-APS criteria, with a 21-month cumulative risk of psychosis  of 28.17\% vs 6.49\%, respectively. The DSM-5-APS prognostic accuracy was acceptable  (AUC 0.76 at 24 months) and similar to the CAARMS 12/2006. The DSM-5-APS designation  may be clinically useful to guide the provision of indicated interventions within a  7\%-35\% (2-year) range of psychosis risk. The removal of the criterion E or C of the  DSM-5-APS may improve its prognostic performance and transdiagnostic value.

However, systematic reviews on the  relevance of this for health services are unavailable. Furthermore, whether  association with service use is confounded by other psychopathology is unknown, and  is relevant to prevention and treatment. OBJECTIVES: Literature examining  associations between PEs and service use was systematically reviewed. Study quality  and the direction and extent of any associations were assessed, and meta-analysis  conducted. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out as per  PRISMA guidelines. A search of electronic databases was performed based on free-text  and structured terms. Included studies were evaluated by two raters using a  structured tool and estimates extracted for reporting. RESULTS: Thirteen studies  were returned. We found two prospective studies, and a minority of studies accounted  for concurrent psychopathology, limiting our ability to test our main hypotheses.  Five studies reported associations by different types of service use. Almost all  studies assessed service use by self-report. Meta-analysis suggested that people who  reported PEs were around twice as likely to report service use compared to those who  did not (pooled OR for all included studies: 2.20,95\% confidence intervals (95\%CI):  1.66,2.91). CONCLUSIONS: There was consistent evidence of association between PEs  and mental health service use at the general population level. However, evidence for  causation was poor due to a limited number of studies.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The impact of precision psychiatry for clinical practice has not been systematically appraised. This study aims to provide a comprehensive review of  validated prediction models to estimate the individual risk of being affected with a  condition (diagnostic), developing outcomes (prognostic), or responding to  treatments (predictive) in mental disorders. METHODS: PRISMA/RIGHT/CHARMS-compliant  systematic review of the Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Reviews, and  Ovid/PsycINFO databases from inception until July 21, 2019 (PROSPERO CRD42019155713)  to identify diagnostic/prognostic/predictive prediction studies that reported  individualized estimates in psychiatry and that were internally or externally  validated or implemented. Random effect meta-regression analyses addressed the  impact of several factors on the accuracy of prediction models. FINDINGS: Literature  search identified 584 prediction modeling studies, of which 89 were included. 10.4\%  of the total studies included prediction models internally validated (n = 61), 4.6\%  models externally validated (n = 27), and 0.2\% (n = 1) models considered for  implementation. Across validated prediction modeling studies (n = 88), 18.2\% were  diagnostic, 68.2\% prognostic, and 13.6\% predictive. The most frequently investigated  condition was psychosis (36.4\%), and the most frequently employed predictors  clinical (69.5\%). Unimodal compared to multimodal models (β = .29, P = .03) and  diagnostic compared to prognostic (β = .84, p {\textless} .0001) and predictive (β = .87, P =  .002) models were associated with increased accuracy. INTERPRETATION: To date,  several validated prediction models are available to support the diagnosis and  prognosis of psychiatric conditions, in particular, psychosis, or to predict  treatment response. Advancements of knowledge are limited by the lack of  implementation research in real-world clinical practice. A new generation of  implementation research is required to address this translational gap.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Using novel data mining methods such as natural language processing (NLP) on electronic health records (EHRs) for screening and detecting individuals at  risk for psychosis. METHOD: The study included all patients receiving a first index  diagnosis of nonorganic and nonpsychotic mental disorder within the South London and  Maudsley (SLaM) NHS Foundation Trust between January 1, 2008, and July 28, 2018.  Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)-regularized Cox regression  was used to refine and externally validate a refined version of a five-item  individualized, transdiagnostic, clinically based risk calculator previously  developed (Harrell's C = 0.79) and piloted for implementation. The refined version  included 14 additional NLP-predictors: tearfulness, poor appetite, weight loss,  insomnia, cannabis, cocaine, guilt, irritability, delusions, hopelessness, disturbed  sleep, poor insight, agitation, and paranoia. RESULTS: A total of 92 151 patients  with a first index diagnosis of nonorganic and nonpsychotic mental disorder within  the SLaM Trust were included in the derivation (n = 28 297) or external validation  (n = 63 854) data sets. Mean age was 33.6 years, 50.7\% were women, and 67.0\% were of  white race/ethnicity. Mean follow-up was 1590 days. The overall 6-year risk of  psychosis in secondary mental health care was 3.4 (95\% CI, 3.3-3.6). External  validation indicated strong performance on unseen data (Harrell's C 0.85, 95\% CI  0.84-0.86), an increase of 0.06 from the original model. CONCLUSIONS: Using NLP on  EHRs can considerably enhance the prognostic accuracy of psychosis risk calculators.  This can help identify patients at risk of psychosis who require assessment and  specialized care, facilitating earlier detection and potentially improving patient  outcomes.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Neurocognitive functioning is a potential biomarker to advance detection, prognosis, and preventive care for individuals at clinical high risk for  psychosis (CHR-P). The current consistency and magnitude of neurocognitive  functioning in individuals at CHR-P are undetermined. OBJECTIVE: To provide an  updated synthesis of evidence on the consistency and magnitude of neurocognitive  functioning in individuals at CHR-P. DATA SOURCES: Web of Science database, Cochrane  Central Register of Reviews, and Ovid/PsycINFO and trial registries up to July 1,  2020. STUDY SELECTION: Multistep literature search compliant with Preferred  Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses and Meta-analysis of  Observational Studies in Epidemiology performed by independent researchers to  identify original studies reporting on neurocognitive functioning in individuals at  CHR-P. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Independent researchers extracted the data,  clustering the neurocognitive tasks according to 7 Measurement and Treatment  Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) domains and 8 CHR-P  domains. Random-effect model meta-analyses, assessment of publication biases and  study quality, and meta-regressions were conducted. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The  primary effect size measure was Hedges g of neurocognitive functioning in  individuals at CHR-P (1) compared with healthy control (HC) individuals or (2)  compared with individuals with first-episode psychosis (FEP) or (3) stratified for  the longitudinal transition to psychosis. RESULTS: A total of 78 independent studies  were included, consisting of 5162 individuals at CHR-P (mean [SD; range] age, 20.2  [3.3; 12.0-29.0] years; 2529 [49.0\%] were female), 2865 HC individuals (mean [SD;  range] age, 21.1 [3.6; 12.6-29.2] years; 1490 [52.0\%] were female), and 486  individuals with FEP (mean [SD; range] age, 23.0 [2.0; 19.1-26.4] years; 267 [55.9\%]  were female). Compared with HC individuals, individuals at CHR-P showed medium to  large deficits on the Stroop color word reading task (g = -1.17; 95\% CI, -1.86 to  -0.48), Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (g = -0.86; 95\% CI, -1.43 to -0.28),  digit symbol coding test (g = -0.74; 95\% CI, -1.19 to -0.29), Brief Assessment of  Cognition Scale Symbol Coding (g = -0.67; 95\% CI, -0.95 to -0.39), University of  Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (g = -0.55; 95\% CI, -0.97 to -0.12), Hinting  Task (g = -0.53; 95\% CI, -0.77 to -0.28), Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test  (g = -0.50; 95\% CI, -0.78 to -0.21), California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT)  (g = -0.50; 95\% CI, -0.64 to -0.36), and National Adult Reading Test (g = -0.52; 95\%  CI, -1.01 to -0.03). Individuals at CHR-P were less impaired than individuals with  FEP. Longitudinal transition to psychosis from a CHR-P state was associated with  medium to large deficits in the CVLT task (g = -0.58; 95\% CI, -1.12 to -0.05).  Meta-regressions found significant effects for age and education on processing  speed. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Findings from this meta-analysis support  neurocognitive dysfunction as a potential detection and prognostic biomarker in  individuals at CHR-P. These findings may advance clinical research and inform  preventive approaches.},

METHODS: We conducted a  PRISMA/MOOSE-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis of Web of Science to  identify studies comparing post-test efficacy (effect size [ES]; Hedges' g) of  universal or selective interventions for poor mental health outcomes versus control  groups, in samples with mean age {\textless}35 years (PROSPERO: CRD42018102143). Measurements  included random-effects models, I2 statistics, publication bias, meta-regression,  sensitivity analyses, quality assessments, number needed to treat, and population  impact number. RESULTS: 295 articles (447,206 individuals; mean age = 15.4)  appraising 17 poor mental health outcomes were included. Compared to control  conditions, universal and selective interventions improved (in descending magnitude  order) interpersonal violence, general psychological distress, alcohol use, anxiety  features, affective symptoms, other emotional and behavioral problems, consequences  of alcohol use, posttraumatic stress disorder features, conduct problems, tobacco  use, externalizing behaviors, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder features, and  cannabis use, but not eating-related problems, impaired functioning, internalizing  behavior, or sleep-related problems. Psychoeducation had the highest effect size for  ADHD features, affective symptoms, and interpersonal violence. Psychotherapy had the  highest effect size for anxiety features. CONCLUSION: Universal and selective  preventive interventions for young individuals are feasible and can improve poor  mental health outcomes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Primary indicated prevention is a key target for reducing the incidence and burden of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. An individualised,  clinically-based transdiagnostic model for the detection of individuals at risk of  psychosis has been developed and validated in two large, urban healthcare providers.  We tested its external validity in a geographically and demographically different  non-urban population. METHOD: Retrospective EHR cohort study. All individuals  accessing secondary healthcare provided by Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust  between 1st January 2011 and 30th November 2019 and receiving a primary index  diagnosis of a non-psychotic or non-organic mental disorder were considered  eligible. The previously developed model was applied to this database and its  external prognostic accuracy was measured with Harrell's C. FINDINGS: The study  included n = 33,710 eligible individuals, with an average age of 27.7 years  (SD = 19.8), mostly white (92.0\%) and female (57.3\%). The mean follow-up was  1863.9 days (SD = 948.9), with 868 transitions to psychosis and a cumulative  incidence of psychosis at 6 years of 2.9\% (95\%CI: 2.7-3.1). Compared to the urban  development database, Oxford Health was characterised by a relevant case mix, lower  incidence of psychosis, different distribution of baseline predictors, higher  proportion of white females, and a lack of specialised clinical services for at risk  individuals. Despite these differences the model retained an adequate prognostic  performance (Harrell's C = 0.79, 95\%CI: 0.78-0.81), with no major miscalibration.  INTERPRETATION: The transdiagnostic, individualised, clinically-based risk  calculator is transportable outside urban healthcare providers. Further research  should test transportability of this risk prediction model in an international  setting.},

Our aim was to  comprehensively meta-analytically evaluate for the first time a wide range of  clinical and functional outcomes beyond transition to psychosis in CHR-P  individuals. METHODS: PubMed and Web of Science were searched until November 2020 in  this PRISMA compliant meta-analysis (PROSPERO:CRD42020206271). Individual  longitudinal studies conducted in individuals at CHR-P providing data on at least  one of our outcomes of interest were included. We carried out random-effects  pairwise meta-analyses, meta-regressions, and assessed publication bias and study  quality. Analyses were two-tailed with α=0.05. FINDINGS: 75 prospective studies were  included (n=5,288, age=20.0 years, females=44.5\%). Attenuated positive symptoms  improved at 12 (Hedges' g=0.753, 95\%CI=0.495-1.012) and 24 (Hedges' g=0.836,  95\%CI=0.463-1.209), but not ≥36 months (Hedges' g=0.315. 95\%CI=-0.176-0.806).  Negative symptoms improved at 12 (Hedges' g=0.496, 95\%CI=0.315-0.678), but not 24  (Hedges' g=0.499, 95\%CI=-0.137-1.134) or ≥36 months (Hedges' g=0.033,  95\%CI=-0.439-0.505). Depressive symptoms improved at 12 (Hedges' g=0.611,  95\%CI=0.441-0.782) and 24 (Hedges' g=0.583, 95\%CI=0.364-0.803), but not ≥36 months  (Hedges' g=0.512 95\%CI=-0.337-1.361). Functioning improved at 12 (Hedges' g=0.711,  95\%CI=0.488-0.934), 24 (Hedges' g=0.930, 95\%CI=0.553-1.306) and ≥36 months (Hedges'  g=0.392, 95\%CI=0.117-0.667). Remission from CHR-P status occurred in 33.4\%  (95\%CI=22.6-44.1\%) at 12 months, 41.4\% (95\%CI=32.3-50.5\%) at 24 months and 42.4\%  (95\%CI=23.4-61.3\%) at ≥36 months. Heterogeneity across the included studies was  significant and ranged from I(2)=53.6\% to I(2)=96.9\%. The quality of the included  studies (mean±SD) was 4.6±1.1 (range=2-8). INTERPRETATION: CHR-P individuals improve  on symptomatic and functional outcomes over time, but these improvements are not  maintained in the longer term, and less than half fully remit.
